CS1101S,"This course introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory course to computing. Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the course introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The course begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include: functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing."," −+mario lorenzo 6 years agotaken in ay 18/19 sem 2 lecturer: dr. low kok-limgrading scheme: 4% studio attendance, 2% studio participation, 4% reflection attendance, 20% mission, 15% midterm, 15% practical assessment, 40% finalthis is the first time cs 1101 s is offered in sem 2 and even though no contest and sumobot events at this semester, i have to say that this mod is one of the cool mods in soc. for non-soc students, this module can be taken only in sem 2 (unless if you submit an appeal) if offered again next year. this module requires high level of consistency since the proportions of module are equally spreaded between cas and exams. this module's contents are based from structure and interpretation of computer programs book by abelson and sussman that can be found online, and this mod is divided into 3 sections (functions (simple, higher-order, substitution model), data (pairs, lists, trees), and state (mutable data, envrionment model, loops and arrays) this semester, instead of 4 sections since the concepts of metacircular evaluator and streams are not introduced in the mod this semester. another thing to point out is that unlike other cs 1010 equivalents, cs 1101 s introduces loops after midterm (that sometimes makes students with little programming experiences found that it's a bit tricky) in order to sharpen the recursive way of thinking. the content of this module is slightly (or maybe significantly) harder than other cs 1010 equivalent. so for non-soc students, you may want to reconsider this option to fulfill your cs 1010 requirement. this mod is not bell-curved (according to what they said which i sometimes doubt lol).dr. low kok-lim is a great lecturer that is able to deliver the concepts in simple packs so that the concepts are very easy to be digested. he is responsive to queries and patiently explains the doubts to the students. even though the lectures are webcasted, it is strongly encouraged to come to the lectures if you feel that you are lost since it will be helpful and you can ask any queries to dr. kok-lim.there are weekly studios (equivalent to tutorials) and reflections (equivalent to recitations) where attendances are taken. additionally, there are 2% proportion of studio participation in order to make the class active. you also may be required to submit the studio works to your avenger before coming to the studios and the submissions are counted for participation marks, despite the correctness of the answers. also, there are missions that are accounted for 20% of total marks. missions may be very hard sometimes and require a while to get into the solutions. if you are diligent enough, you may also want to do the side quests. side-quests are not counted for cs 1101 s' marks. instead, doing side-quests giving additional xps (the system for cs 1101 s is gamified). sufficient xps can obtain additional 1 mc in form of cs 1010 r in the next semester and you have the option to drop or keep the grades.do the past year papers for the exams, and you will be fine. the concept tested in the exams are similar between papers, with exception of this year's final since this year's final is somewhat easier than the past year papers. the principles for the exams: grab as much points as you can by doing all the easy questions in your pov, spam the hard questions. cs 1101 s' graders are pretty lenient in giving partial marks.last but not least, cs 1101 s rocks! no regret of taking cs 1101 s instead of taking other cs 1010 equivalent as a chemical engineering student.expected grade: a+actual grade: a+see more 40 replyshare ›−+ttigermario lorenzo 6 years agoeditedhow many mods were you doing at that time?see more 00 replyshare ›−+mario lorenzotiger 6 years agohi there!

(fun fact: a lot of people still do not know how to simplify the lambda implementations of - pair, head, tail - even towards the end of the course!)before midterms:1. play around with abstractions like accumulate, map, filter. alongside recursive functions, those will be your 'loops' (since loops have not been taught yet). also venture into 2 d list territory, be comfortable when dealing with them.2. read up and discuss with your studio about master theorem (not covered in syllabus). isn't too hard + provides you with a standard way of solving the time complexity questions efficiently. if you're still not sure, write down the 3 cases on your cheatsheet.before ra 2, master drawing environment models. read up on the other topics tested, cuz most people were caught off guard this year by cse + stream qns.before pa, at least attempt the harder past year papers/questions. 23/24 final qn was notably hard. (this may be a little extreme) if insufficient, search leetcode for easy difficulty qns, and 'linked list' qns, then attempt to solve them in source playground while making use of the available abstractions.before finals, just revise everything. prioritize all content except metacircular evaluator (honestly just study for some other subject instead of this nonsense). metacircular evaluator is hard to grasp, since you're essentially reading hundreds of lines of abstractions made by someone else. tens of hours of understanding is (probably) not worth the <10% that comes out in the exam. when revising pyps, do be aware of the implementation of certain abstractions since they may change over the years. for example, the implementation of eval_stream changed in 24/25, causing great confusion when doing pyps.note that the majority of people will be putting in a disproportionate amount of time and effort into this 4 mc course. if you aren't performing well, might as well grind something else like cs 1231 s or ma 1521, which are bell-curved and people also dedicate less time to.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+ssocacademicvictim 6 months agoeditedtaken in ay 24/25

trying to do the mission. for prior context, i do have quite a bit of coding experience and i found this mod tough.some of the missions are stupidly toughcough cough corrective sky surgery.probably a good idea to work with your friends or somethingcontent:i cant even remember what we learn exactly, but the main bulk is the idea of recursion and pair-list structures, environmental models and some meta-circular bs.if you want to prepare for this mod, i recommend understanding linked lists and trees and arrays. these 3 seems like the most popular topics they test when it comes to coding, so much so that i think my prior knowledge actually saved me from failing a few times. practice recursive thinking as thats the bulk of the content anyways.exams:exams is like almost non stop.ra 1: the paper

everyone you know around you is probably failing or something but somehow the median is like 70 % or something. i feel that you could prepare for the mod but it really boils down to whether you can see through their tricks. i felt that i did not struggle much with coding but the theoretical aspects of the mod, i.e meta-circular, control and stash. oh and one more thing, they love to test people with a shit ton of mcqs that are somehow worth 4-5 marks ??? so you can quite literally get below median just by getting 5 or so mcqs wrong, and there are like 6-7 options so good luck guessing. not

y 2 cs student, recitation was boyd.tldr: too much effort for a 4 mc mod.i felt like i was on track at first, then ra 1 was where i first experienced being victim to the bell curve. difficulty of paper was artificially inflated by having a few hard qns in a relatively easier paper. i felt midterms was harder than previous years too, but the median says otherwise; it just keeps going up over the years although difficulty is higher too. practical felt especially catered to distinguish within the cs gods themselves while us in below median get completely destroyed. the only test that was actually easier than pyp was ra 2. by finals, i completely gave up on 1101 since it was on the same day as ma 1522 anyways (i would say that 1101 finals was pretty hard, but take it with a pinch of salt since i didn't bother to do any pyp for finals). assessments just feel harder year on year, and most of the time, you have to take extra effort to learn stuff outside of lecture since assessments test stuff beyond what is taught (especially ra 1). that being said, turnover rate for marking is very fast for 1101.essentially almost 30% is free via 24 k xp, mastery checks etc. however, the 24 k xp was very hard to get. i recommend grinding quests(quests are optional) at the start to farm more xp as missions(compulsory) get harder and harder over the weeks go. i found myself spending hours on each individual mission that only opens for like 4-6 days usually, and they just keep coming and coming like a never-ending barrage of bullets. i was so glad when i finally hit 24 k xp and didnt have to check source academy once every alternate day for any new mission i didn't know about. plus there are way too many tests that its like once every few weeks.regarding teaching, i think my ta was alright, a y 2 student just like most tas. boyd was a pretty great recitation tutor, shout out to him. btw, recitation is like a mini lecture where new content gets taught, so it is important. abt lecturers, the general sentiment among my batch was that ppl didn't like kok lim's lectures (ppl rated his lectures 1 and 2 stars on canvas), and that martin henz's slides were pretty lacklustre for a very important chapter (cse machine). i don't think they are bad, its just relative performance to boyd and sankar.overall, i think this course does teach certain important concepts e.g. recursion, higher order functions, streams, mutable data, memoization, but my opinion is that it was taught in a sub-optimal manner. there was absolutely no need to be using source, and the documentation pales in comparison to actual documentation. i can barely google anything to help with my coding, unlike in real world where i can actually find people facing same issues on coding forums.should you take 1010 x for the exemption? imo, definitely if you do not want to be frustrated over source. h/w, thats my personal opinion, others may disagree and say concepts in 1101 are too valuable to be passed.

vital to shaping how you think as a programmer. i would recommend 9/10 of poly students to revoke their exemption, as the things covered in 1101 s are not truly covered in any part of your curriculum in poly.workloadthe workload can get extremely heavy. generally, the best way to approach this mod is to truly grind it at the start of the semester. without experience, you will definitely lose a lot of time to this mod, but having completed the 24000 xp requirement at midterms allowed me much more time to focus on other mods after it. you should be hitting 18 k by midterms at the very least.curriculumextremely steep learning curve, especially for those without experience. honestly, the mod gives you an impetus to effectively change your way of approaching problems if you're used to just hacking something together to get an end result, which is pretty interesting and fun, but super challenging at the start.as you will come to learn as a cs student, your mods will be the same as adjacent mods under different codes. you won't be learning python, instead a javascript-esque language made for the module called source. my opinion is that realistically this wouldn't matter, because a good programmer should be able to switch languages, but learning programming through a single language may have introduced bad coding habits, so come in with an open mind.teachingi was under prof boyd for reflections, and found him to be extremely passionate in what he taught, and very clear in his explanations. in general, i didn't follow lectures after the first unit because my zoom kept crashing on my desktop. lectures seemed fine, but i tended to just attempt to learn everything from the slides on my own (probably not the best approach).the tas are the lifeblood of this course, and i salute them for the effort they put in into the studios, and the constant help that they give outside and inside studios.advicethe mod can be extremely discouraging. you will see people with no experience pick it up extremely fast, and there is a lot of instances where you will feel inferior. the truth is you cannot grind this module in the same ways you are used to. come in with an open mind, and be prepared to change how you approach problems.expected grade: a (87.7%)actual grade:tbcsee more 10 replyshare ›−+zaizaia year agoactual grade: a!not surprised, but if an 87 is only an a

practical assessment and 1 final exam.programming assessments in the form of missions, paths, quests are given out on a weekly basis on source academy, the online platform the module uses. there are also a few contests where students get to express their creativity. these assessments provide exp, which constituted 18% of the module grade. however, the threshold for getting the full 18% is only about ~63% of the total exp, so doing only the missions + some quests should suffice. doing more, however, is rewarded through the 1 mc mod cs 1010 r, which is offered in semester 2. extra exp attained beyond the threshold will determine one's grade in cs 1010 r, so if one does almost all the missions, paths, etc, an a/a+ for cs 1010 r should be guaranteed.the module places more emphasis on functional programming and recursive thinking at the beginning (source 1 and source 2 don't even have loops!), and teaches the iterative approach at the second half of the module. i feel that this is quite different from other programming courses, that usually teaches iterative thinking and dive into loops early on. having had some prior experience programming before this module, i think that this approach is actually rather helpful as it ""forces"" students to understand the philosophy of functional, effect-free programming better, and generally programs in the functional programming paradigm tend to be more understandable and easier to debug in the long run.this mod was held during covid period, so tutorial slots were split into face-to-face and zoom sessions. i took the zoom tutorial slot. apart from the usual weekly tutorial, we did mastery checks (as pairs) and the ev 3 programming (as a tutorial group).there were two mastery checks, where tutorial mates pair up and explain to our avenger (tutor) the content we learnt so far, which helped to correct any misconceptions we may have had, before moving on with the module. despite it having been the covid period, we still had the robot programming section with the lego ev 3 s, which was done through zoom + source academy.due to covid, tests were held online through luminus and invigilated through zoom proctoring. screen recordings also had to be captured and uploaded. it was more tedious to set up compared to a physical exam, but has the advantage in the sense that answers could be edited easily (as we entered code through a text box in luminus), compared to writing code down on paper.overall, cs 1101 s was quite thought-provoking and enjoyable.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+xxo 6 years

15/16 under prof. martin henz and prof. low kok-limso my peers have already written really substantial reviews but i thought i'll try to write one without all the jargons to better appeal to matriculating students with no experience in nus nor experience in anything remotely related to programming.// the dummy's guide to cs 1101 sif i were tasked with training a child to write an essay in 3 months, there are at least two ways i can go about doing it:1) i could start by introducing her to grammar, vocabulary and the like, and then getting her to write some essays (and she'll have to write a lot of essays just so i am sure she's got her basics down). my goal here would be to make sure she is familiar enough with the language to actually form sentences on her own.2) i could bombard her with classics. she will be made to read shakespeare in week 1, vonnegut in week 2, js mills in week 3, etc. and write essays immediately after for practice. oh, she's swahili and have never heard of the english language before? i'm sure she'll understand english after reading a few books. learning the language is trivial; what matters here is that she learns how a good essay is written.in both scenarios, the sentences ""write properly cn alr"", ""the ability to compose a sentence, within reasonable bounds of competence, is adequate for our purposes"", and ""writing a simple sentence is good enough"" are all functionally equivalent. at this point, they are all fine with me as long as the child is able to communicate her ideas. in the second scenario, however, the child is more likely to write in a more elegant manner now and in the future because that's the only form of writing she has been exposed to.i'm sure you've guessed it by now: the second scenario represents cs 1101 s.// prerequisitesyeah, the workload is immense (people take about 6-8 hours on average a week to finish their homework) and intellectually demanding, but don't be scared off by the naysayers who say you need prior programming experience!i didn't have experience and i did fine. all you need to succeed in this module is love <3 when you sleep at night and your crush appears in your dream, you need to slap yourself awake and dream of cs 1101 s instead.when you're waiting in line for food and instinctively look at your phone because you have nothing better to do, take a second to appreciate technology... then proceed to do cs 1101 s on your phone.if you shower cs 1101 s with lots of love, it will reciprocate accordingly.// pre-cs 1101 s adviceokay, seriously if you're worried about being able to cope, take a look at the first few chapters of structure and interpretation of computer programs (sicp) textbook or watch some of the associated 1986 mit lectures (both freely available online). being able to follow the syllabus in sicp without difficulty should net you a decent grade in cs 1101 s.i would advise against taking cs 1101 s alongside modules (or hall cca) with heavy workloads. keep 3-10 hours of your weekly schedule open. cs 1101 s is only fun if you have the time to fully immerse yourself in it! from anecdotal evidence, you'll probably only get good grades if you have fun.// gradesyou really shouldn't be reading this section because grades shouldn't matter as much as the fun you get out of the module. but if you're reeeeeeeally looking for some credentials

math background and no programming experience and i can say i perform quite well compared to my peers.if you are quite confident with your programming experience, you might want to think again. you will not use loops or arrays at all except for the practical and final exams. you will see a lot of hard stuff such as higher-order functions and infinite lists (streams).the avengers know that you are put into real shit and will help you a lot. go bug them a lot shamelessly. it's for your good.module is taught in jediscript which is pretty much javascript. the platform is gamified - you earn xp by doing the missions (assignments) and you level up after getting a certain amount of xp. there are sidequests and contests as well that serve as time sinks (but everyone does them anyways because kiasuness).you'll start by learning programming basics; in week 2 you'll learn recursion and in week 3 you'll learn higher order functions already. by week 5 you'll start doing list processing with even more higher order functions (filter, map, accumulate/fold). then comes the midterms, and after that you'll be exposed to many concepts. you'll learn: mutating data, object-oriented programming, streams (lazy evaluation, infinite data structures), meta-circular interpreter (very hard) before finally slowing down to get a glimpse on html 5, javascript and cs meta.see more 10 replyshare

banderson, hartin menz, lok kim, and prof sankaworkload:different from past reviewers on this site, actually workload for cs 1101 s is moderate(even without much past experience to programming). i only had little exposure to coding before entering uni, not to mention the notion of “recursion” and “wishful thinking”. i believe past experience did not really matter in this course, because the profs will explain everything we need to know clearly and patiently. don’t worry if u heard that cs 1101 s has “heavy workload” or “steep learning curve”. js follow the lectures and try ur best to tackle each mission/quest and u will get a good result.content:we started from shaping the “recursive thinking” skills, then shifted to data structures like lists and trees, without the introduction of variables/loops etc until after midterm. then we covered the basic use of loops, arrays and variables, with a powerful model called cse(control, stash, environment) machine. last part of lecture was about writing a metacircular evaluator, which is basically using the source language to implement an interpreter for itself! but sadly i didn’t really learnt these fun stuff bc i was travelling at that time.assessment:ra 1 was a great toll on me bc i was completely confused by the weird rules of scoping in source language. midterm includes more mcq than past yrs and thus has less challenging open-ended qns. doing missions and quests will definitely help a lot here.one week before ra 2 i stopped studying for this course, bc i realized the importance to enjoy my life instead of confining myself to nus. thus my review here can’t provide much valuable information. but from what i recall, ra 2 is quite challenging, esp those stream qns which truly require a sharp mind. practical assessment is the easiest among all exams that i took in this sem, bc there were testcases for each qn for u to check ur answer. the probability of making careless mistakes is really low. i finished in 40 min and had to wait for another one hour bc they didn’t allow us to leave early.for final exam i did quite terrible though i didn’t care anyway(probably bc i was too chill during exam weeks lol). but the paper was indeed harder than midterm and i made some careless mistakes(from what i recall, but i never view my paper on softmark). plz prepare well for final exam if u want to pull ur grade up a notch bc it counts for 30% of ur overall.ra 1: 18/20 midterm: 100/100 ra 2: 61/61 pa: 60/60 final: 92.5/100 overall: ~97%expected grade: no expectationfinal words(irrelevant)university life is for yall to enjoy, grade is not all that matters(although it really does matter for me……) if u can’t see the purpose of study, or u can’t withstand the academic pressure, plz take ur mind on a

hard for me to describe precisely what i was thinking, but it felt like a lot of time was wasted yet i was still tired bc of nothing. my way out of this was to travel & to try good food! it really

and then changing the meta after new paradigms were introduced. felt like this course made me think on my feet quicker, and helps develop intuition for cs problem solving. some missions are excruiciatingly difficult, but enjoyable to crack with friends.my advice:1) study with friends, don't take it alone 2) try and teach your friends concepts that you have started to understand, helps with retention 3) past year papers are essential. ra 1 will be about code tracing. midterms will be heavily mcq and code tracing based. ra 2 will be about the environment model and cse machine. practical will be about problem solving (some leetcode might help? i didn't really do it). finals will be about parsing the psets with speed and writing sa code.other assignments:source academy

""missions"" (homework), and ""quests"" (optional additional practices) to complete. each of these assignments award xp upon completion. a minimum of 300 xp is also given after attending each studio session. reaching 24000 xp in source academy would award the full 14% for the ""sa achievements"" component. anything lower would be pro-rated accordingly. students can easily exceed the threshold of 24000 as long as you consistently complete your paths and missions, and attend studios.lectures are solely held online and recorded, 2 hours twice a week. you have around 36 hours to complete the path for that lecture once it is finished. there are usually 2 paths and 3 missions a week. missions usually take around 4 to 5 hours for the average student, and are the basis for understanding lecture content. i took a few days to complete some of them with the help of my ta.studios are tutorial sessions held in groups of 8 with a ta, who is most likely a y 2 student. there are studio sheets, which are homework assignments to be completed before each studio. the ta will go through the studio sheet during lesson, and move on to an in-class worksheet after that. make good use of your ta by asking questions and clarifying doubts.reflections are weekly 1-hour sessions conducted by more senior students (undergraduates and postgraduates), and the profs themselves.  there will be a reflection sheet to be completed before class. the teacher will go through the reflection sheet and reinforce key concepts for that week's lectures. reflection tutors are the best source of help you can find, so do consult them regularly.mastery checks are verbal presentations where students must convince their studio ta of their understanding of topics taught up to that point. the mastery checks are not graded and you will be awarded the full 3% for that component once your ta is satisfied with your presentation. you can attempt this as many times as you want.the key concepts in cs 1101 s are: recursion, lambda functions, lists, streams, arrays, loops, orders of growth, environment model. these topics weigh over 80% of the marks for finals so it is important to understand them well. the first step after each lecture is to be aware of what you understand and don't, before being able to ask your tutors about it.the practical assessment is the only exam where students are allowed to code on a computer.please make sure your code compilesby hard coding the base cases if you have to. (my code could not compile in 4 out of 6 questions and i got 22/60 for this exam.)the workload is very heavy, and you can expect to spend up to 20 hours a week on this course's content and assignments. some saturdays will be used for exams. this can be very stressful for many students, especially those with no coding experience (like me).finals will be difficult with many tricky questions. your tutors will go through some of the more challenging questions in past-year papers during lessons. ask for more examples if you need.overall advice: coding experience isn't all that important in this course, so don't be too freaked out by it. the main issue that students will face is the inability to solve exam problems and understand abstract programming functions. practice is key to avoid doing badly for these exams. complete all the given missions and practice papers before each exam, get a full understanding of the abovementioned key concepts and you should be fine.p.s. the last topic (metalinguistic abstraction) is a ridiculously abstract and redundant topic that took up a mere 8/100 marks for finals. feel free to skip it completely as i did since it won't be of much use in later courses anyway.workload: 8/10 difficulty: 8/10 final grade: b+ (71.6%)see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ggamer 5 months agoediteday 24/25 sem 1 the introductory course for cs students, teaching the fundamentals of programming and computational thinking. i won’t further touch upon the exact syllabus and grading breakdown as i think that has been thoroughly covered by other reviewers, but here are some of my personal thoughts and details that might be useful.overviewi went into this course with a decent amount of programming experience. this course definitely focusses on building a strong foundation for understanding and communicating computational processes, rather than teaching you how to code purely for function. so for those who have previously taken crash courses on programming (perhaps outside of other uni-level cs courses), it might be a bit surprising when you are suddenly restricted from using variables, loops, arrays etc. that you might be used to relying upon, and instead have to use recursion and higher-order functions to complete your tasks (at least, until after midterms). i actually quite appreciate this design, as it allowed me to build upon my fundamentals and gain insight on the theory side of programming which i wasn’t previously exposed to.i think having prior experience goes a long way in understanding the course material (especially if you know javascript and its quirks), but definitely don’t get complacent as a good portion of the course is still likely to be conceptually new to you. you will need to keep up with the lectures and not fall behind, as the earlier topics are important in understanding later ones. if you do not have prior experience, i do think the learning curve is significantly steeper, but there are many resources available to you, so it’s definitely very possible to do well if you put in the effort. so don’t be too afraid if you see people in chat yapping about random concepts in the first lecture.weekly schedulemon or tue: 2 h studio session. these are in-person 6-8 person small group tutorials led by an avenger (ta), who will typically be a y 2/3 student. attendance is graded (3%) and so is participation (2%).wed: 2 h lecture. these are held via zoom and recorded. no attendance is taken.thu: 1 h reflection session. these are in-person 25-30 person sessions led by either the profs themselves or phd students. attendance is graded (5%) but participation isn’t.fri: 2 h lecture. same as the wed one, but sometimes shorter.it depends on your personal preference for pace, but i strongly recommend at least viewing the lecture recording within 1-2 days of it being released for a couple of reasons, both to make sure you don’t fall behind, but also because the following reflection / studio will very quickly follow and will be using the lecture’s content. if you are planning to watch the recording immediately after the lecture, do note that the recording might not release immediately and sometimes takes a couple of hours to process.for studios, there will usually be a studio sheet of around 2-4 questions that you should attempt before the session. it doesn’t directly lead to class participation marks (not collected or anything), but i think it is quite hard to participate in class if you are not prepared for the discussion. most of them are quite doable. note that there will also generally be an in-class question that you will do and discuss during the session.similarly for reflections, there will also be a reflection sheet. it’s good to attempt, but i think not as important as studios because 1. the session is more a traditional classroom style rather than a discussion, so you can follow just fine if you just pay attention and 2. there’s no class participation score. so if your schedule is tight between the previous lecture and this session, no need to be too concerned.source academythis is a free 14% of the grade that you get from attaining 24000 xp. sounds like a lot, but i think it’s very hard not to hit this threshold if you’re just moderately disciplined. even if you’ve passed the threshold, though, i think it’s good to keep doing if you have the time, as it’s good to gauge your understanding of the material. the number after the + is the bonus xp that you get for submitting early (within 24 h for paths (+25) and within 72 h for missions / quests (+75), it scales down linearly with time after that).18 paths (+1 first one which doesn’t count) - 2650 + 450 xp: typically one after each lecture, consists of both mcq questions (if you’re desperate, you can just keep hitting buttons until it goes green) as well as coding questions (just pass the test cases).20 missions - 19870 + 1500 xp: your main source of homework, anywhere from 1-3 missions per week. there are 3 robot missions that you will be doing together with your studio group.10 quests - 6020 + 750 xp: tougher questions, no need to do if you don’t have the time, but it’s a good challenge.12 studios - 5800 xp: 300 per studio if you show up, any more is based on participation, except for the first one which is 300 max. (i believe this is separate from the 3+2% grade for studios but not certain)other miscellaneous: 200 xp for voting in the course survey after unit 1, 3 x 50 xp for voting in competitions, and some amount for participating in the competitions (i didn’t so i don’t know, but if you’re musically or artistically inclined it could be quite fun).so the absolute maximum you can get aside from the competitions is (if my calculations aren’t wrong) 37390 xp for my year. this does change year-to-year though, as the previous run had at least 1 more quest. i’d recommend starting off strong at the beginning while you still have plenty of time (getting the early bonus xp, attempting quests etc) so you can worry about it less later if you are really short on time.assessmentsweek 4 - reading assessment 1 (ra 1) - 45 min, closed book (5%) - median: 16/20 week 7 - midterms - 1 h 30 min, cheatsheet (15%) - median: 76/100 week 10 - reading assessment 2 (ra 2) - 45 min, closed book (8%) - median: 41/61 week 12 - practical assessment (pa) - 1 h 40 min, semi-open book (12%) - median: 31/60 finals - 2 h, cheatsheet (30%)firstly, i have no idea why there is a need for there to be assessments on 3 different saturdays (especially seeing as the examinable lecture materials ended on week 11, even accounting for a ph taking away 1 lecture slot). it didn’t seem to be the case last year with 1 h less of lecture per week, so that is to me quite curious.moving to the actual assessments, ra 1 and ra 2 are, as their name implies, primarily focussed on reading code and determining their processes & output using the two mental models (substitution model for ra 1 and environment model for ra 2), and a sprinkling of other questions like orders of growth and the cse machine. these are full mcq papers, and time will be relatively tight for both of them.pa is the only assessment when you will write and execute code, and i think where those with prior experience have the greatest advantage (if you’ve done a lot of leetcode, these shouldn’t be harder than around high-easy/low-medium questions). my year threw a curveball question which had to be done in source 2 though, so do be careful if your confidence with recursion is weak. this is semi?-open book (you can access source documentation, your previous paths/missions/etc. and any physical notes, but no digital materials). also, there might be chaos at the end of the exam when everyone floods the server trying to submit their answers, so don’t be surprised and don’t panic if you’re affected, the invigilators will help you.midterms and finals are of similar format to each other, with some mcq questions like the ras, other questions where you write code (sometimes from scratch if the functions are relatively simple, and other times with the rough structure given to you), as well as stuff like drawing pairs, environment diagrams, tombstone diagrams etc.there’s also 2 mastery checks (one in each half of the sem) where you will explain concepts to your avenger to help make sure you understand them. this is a pass-fail where you can keep trying until you pass so i wouldn’t consider it as an assessment, but it is something you have to (at least lightly) prepare for. i do think these are a little extra as i feel that they serve pretty much the same purpose as ra 1/2.overall, it might feel a little weird to be writing code with a pencil but you’ll get used to it. i feel like mcqs are a little too “all in”, like making one slight error while interpreting a program could lose you like up to 4-5 questions worth of marks. it fortunately didn’t happen to me during an assessment, but i came across that situation in practice papers and i think it would be very frustrating to get zero credit despite getting 95% of the question correct. i do understand the challenge in designing a course for such a large cohort, though, and i guess it is something we will have to live with.final thoughtscs 1101 s was a pretty fun course overall, i’d put it as my favourite for this semester. it’s mostly well-designed as an introductory course and ran quite smoothly throughout. the workload should be among the highest

lots and lots of continual assessment which i guess forced me to revise continually for it as you have your ra 1, mid-terms, ra 2, practical assessment & finals coming at you one after another. the sad part is that it was probably for this reason that the sumo bot fell apart this year because really there is no time to breathe in this module and the back-to-back assessments really overwhelm you

meta-circular evaluator (unpopular) really allowing me to gain an appreciation for various languages out there and their unique features and how i can use the mce to adapt source into the other languages.studio sizes are small (8 pax at most) which i guess helps you make some buddies in the major as you start of. it also helps in being quite open in asking your questions without fear.there

xmost obvious difference is that learning in cs 1101 s will be, at least according to my hearsay, much more engaging. instead of doing stuff otot, there are a lot more ways you can get a community to learn together with.studios(*small group lab*), in-personrecitations(*refreshers*) are just a few examples of the stuff. you can also do fun stuff like sumo competitions and art contests (though it seems my batch didn't really like fun).you can also read more in the ""blabbering"" section about this next part, but basically cs 1101 s places greater emphasis on showing you what's possible with the (limited) concepts at your disposal).in conclusion, on paper, not much changes. but the course philosophy and experience make all the difference.blabberingthe focus isgenuinelyon developing ""good"" programming habits and being able to solve problems usingmultipleways of thinking, instead of just ""to do x you must do y. don't ask why, it just is.""to this end, much effort has been expended to expose even somewhat experienced programmers to new ideas (cps, functional programming) in a way that stays true to the theoretical roots of computer science. (itiswhat you signed up for...)because of this, many decisions made by course coordinators appear contentious. common complaints that ring throughout assignments (""missions/quests"") and assessments are ""no one codes like that!""or ""who uses this in real life!"".yet these decisions are exactly what encourage students to understand theessenceof programming (and programming languages!), ensuring they can approach learning new languages flexibly and smartly (yes, especially the one named like a snake).though not everyone ends up getting the memo, i'd give the module a+++ for effort (and

are specially designed for this course. source is based off javascript, while source academy is where the assignments, online textbook, and video game are located.i did not touch the video game part except for the introduction as it is just to motivate students to do the assignments - it was optional, so i avoided it. the online textbook, ""structure and interpretation of computer programs —

who don't, because it requires them to un-learn and re-learn fundamental concepts. i came into this course with several years of experience with various programs and having built a few fully-fledged

questions and 45 minutes to complete. the questions in ra 2 have different weightages based on their difficulty. environment model will be tested heavily (though for my batch there were less environment model questions), so you will need to be good at drawing the diagram, keeping track of variable values and counting the number of frames. for future cohorts, there might be a greater emphasis on the cse machine which is a more detailed version of the environment model. however, i felt as if the prof could have covered the cse machine in more detail as we were only taught the basics and were left to explore the cse machine on source playground ourselves.practical assessmentyou will be given 2 hours to solve 6-8 ""leetcode easy""-esque questions. the people with experience in programming tend to do better for this component. just make sure to complete the practice pas under time constraint and understand your mistakes well.finalsjust like midterms but harder, and you will be given 2 hours. the environment model, tombstone diagram, cse machine and metacircular evaluator will be tested. the last question might be a code excerpt from the actual metacircular evaluator and you have to make modifications to it. there tends to be more coding questions than midterms from what i noticed, but the format is mostly similar.pathsusually mcq questions and you have multiple tries. there are some coding questions and you need to pass the testcases. paths will contribute a small percentage to your source academy xp.missions and questsone or two missions will be released every week. the time taken to complete might range anywhere from 1 hour to 1 day. i remember struggling a bit at the start with the concept of recursion but towards midterms, i was able to complete the missions quite quickly.one quest is published every week. this is optional, the profs assure you that you don't have to complete it to make it to 24 k xp. since it is optional, it is also more difficult. i attempted all the quests before midterms, and i remember finding some of them very difficult.the xp awarded is based on difficulty. completing all my quests and missions got me to 24 k xp by midterms, and i stopped attempting missions and quests after that. i would not recommend this as i was quite clueless for the cse machine and the metacircular evaluator. just be consistent till finals.mastery checksyou have to explain concepts to your avenger and convince them that you understand the concepts well. it is a pass or fail component, so almost everyone passes.overalli found this mod fun, but some parts of it were quite challenging. also it doesn't help that the exams are back to back (ra 2, practical and finals were 2 weeks apart from each other). finals are over, and i still don't have a good grasp of the concept of metacircular evaluators (which actually seemed to be quite an interesting topic to me).to do well in this mod, you have to be consistent and make sure you have a good grasp of the concepts (e.g. wishful thinking, substitution model). if you don't understand something, you can ask your avenger or even the reflection tutor. the profs also look at the zoom chats during lecture, so you could ask there as well.ratingdifficulty: 6/10 workload: 7/10 enjoyment: 8/10 usefulness: 8/10 gradesra 1: 19/20 (median: 16/20)midterms: 98/100 (median: 76/100)ra 2:

midterms maybe just 2 weeks is ra 2, and then after ra 2 they release the practical exam practice papers, then after pa they release final assessment practice papers! flu keeps spreading around and i had fever both for ra 1 and ra 2 but still took the papers and that was traumatic - so taking care of yourself is important!!workload: 5/5 missions take up about 2-3 h and they release about 2 a week.prepping the studio worksheet takes about 1 h, and the reflection sheets also take about 1 h (for me i like to do them with my own solutions before the sessions)paths: quizzes to be done after lecture, some are all mcqs and quite fast, but some require some coding so 10 - 45 min.the mcqs allow you to try as many times as you want until you get the correct answer, but it is really helpful in consolidating your learning so do not skip throughquests: i did not do quests, but honestly it is because i like to sleep before 11 pm and the workload of all my mods was killing me so i had to adapt to uni (now sleeping 3 am sometimes to get work done t^t but mostly still 11 pm :>) if you can make time to do them though i think it will definitely be helpfuladvicehard work and practice is needed to pick up the skills for the assessments so i think being consistent is very important (as concepts taught in the past lectures will be used in the next lectures and the questions that you do in the missions or in the past year papers might help you in ways you never expect later on)have source academy checked regularly or use the google calendar that the profs share because the various work you need to do (path, mission etc) can get quite confusing at first.also, the missions can take quite a lot of time so start doing them early. i would always do them within the max bonus xp three days so i do not have to stress about all the deadlines. (of course to do this you have to be on track with the lectures though!)there are many avenues for support when things get difficult like the ed forum, tuesday forum hours or even just asking your avenger(ta) or reflection teacher, or even while you are watching the lecture, in the zoom chat. so make full use of this!overallthe mod is pretty stressful especially since everyone is really smart and hardworking and the average grades are always so high.however, i really enjoyed learning about things like how to use mental models to understand what result our code gives us and how our coding languages are designed and work.this mod made me very happy to attend lectures as i am quite active on the zoom chat and the profs always look at the zoom chat to answer questions which encourages a lot of discussions making lectures really fun. it is a good intro mod and i hope that this mod makes u fall in love with computing haha <3 see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+yyilong fenga year agoreviewed by feng yilongtaken in ay 23/24 sem 1 profs: martin henz, boyd anderson, low kok lim, sanka rasnayakagrading scheme: reading assessment 1 5%(week 4) midterm assessment 15%(week 7) reading assessment 2(week 10) 8% practical assessment(week 11) 12% final assessment 30% mastery check 1,2 3%*2 source academy xp 14% studio 5%(3%attendence 2%effort) reflection attendence 5%workload: intense. but manageable if you work hard enough. each mission and quest will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete. although quests are optional, i highly recommend to do it or at least think about it if you have time. those questions can enhance your understanding.

was made during the test, please draw how the question works before start writing the code (or you will spend one hour debugging on two simple questions like me) or just follow eldric’s advice.final: profs may caught you by setting new style of questions. so getting concepts correct is the most important part. and try to think more on the area that does not seems to be important since they may get tested. eg. counting pairs of streams is not considered important, but it got tested during final(11 marks in total for counting pairs).overall: the course is quite entertaining.(may be also

of the course covers functional programming, consisting of unit 1 - functions and unit 2 - data. instead of writing a sequence of instructions, you compose functions to obtain the result you want, similar to math. unit 3 - state introduces the messy world of state, giving you a lot more things to keep track of, which makes things more prone to errors/bugs. finally, unit 4 - beyond wraps things up with streams, metalinguistic abstraction (writing an interpreter for the language in the language itself) and some optional topics. missions cover the main content of the course, and quests stretch your mind further and are really fun, especially functional expressionism. overall, the course content is the best out of every course i have ever taken in my life, and i thoroughly enjoyed

assessment: 30%backgroundi must declare that i did take cs 1010 x before matriculating officially and cs 1101 s, however, these two courses are radically different with not much overlap. as can be seen from the outrageous assessment components, this is definitely not the average 4 mc mod.workloadthe mod is done in source, a subset of javascript developed specifically for cs 1101 s and can be done on a website called ""source academy"".there are 2 online lectures per week, one ""main"" lecture on wednesday (the start of the ""cs 1101 s week"") covering the broad concepts and one ""brief"" lecture (on friday) where they elaborate more about the mission specifics (purportedly).each week on source academy, a mission, quest and path is released. paths are more of refreshers to the lectures and briefs, missions are the main assignments to test your understanding and quests challenge your higher-level understanding and coding skills. paths and missions with some quests should be enough to get you the full 14% for the source academy grade.studios are once a week, 1.5 hour 8 man group tutorials, manned by the student tas. there will be a studio sheet for you to complete before that so try to do it.reflections are once a week, 1 hour recitations where the tutor will go over the concepts covered in lecture. again there will be a reflection sheet to be done before, but i didn't do it.reading assessments 1 and 2 are more like ca 1 and ca 2 in secondary school. they are mcqs and test specific topics, but have low weightage. my year ra 2 was very scuffed so manage expectations.mastery checks 1 and 2 are essentially small unofficial presentations on 3 to 4 concepts (format may differ) over zoom in pairs. you present slides/code snippets/notes to your studio ta to check your understanding. i just wrote some basic code and screenshared it to the ta while explaining.for practical, they allowed unlimited testing with public test case, but grading was done with private test cases automatically, so in theory no prof/ta will ever be involved in the marking. practical was okcontent(in no particular order)1. elements of programming (variables vs constants, etc)2. substitution model 3. recursion 4. orders of growth (time and space complexity, big theta/o/omega)5. iterative and recursive processes 6. higher-order functions 7. scope of names 8. data

and variables)12. environment model (oof)13. loops (for, while, etc)14. memoization 15. streams 16. meta-circular evaluator (evaluate-apply)major roadblock concepts were recursion and wishful thinking, functional expressionism (iykyk) and environment diagrams (ra 2 massacre ahem). for me it was a case of ""if i stare at it long enough i'll maybe get it"" kinda thing, so try to keep practicing and applying these concepts.also learn how to (barely) read confusing af code.cs 1101 s likes to teach confusing and seemingly pointless ideas and thinking strategies, but they all make sense in the end and are robust enough to get by. it has to be said that, definitely, most concepts and ideas taught here pertaining to source are not at all transferrable to the outside world.final thoughts and advicei loved this mod because it was frankly fun, i managed to understand recursion and use it more effectively (which i detested and avoided in cs 1010 x) and it served as a good primer to programmatic thinking, but i also hated it because it was so convoluted and over-complicated at times that writing code and understanding documentation was painfully painful.i advice new cadets to have an open mind, but also don't be afraid to voice out your concerns. this course may be rife with smurfs but the community here is helpful, patient and the fact that you suffer and slog through 13 weeks with your 8-man army in tutorial can make it almost enjoyable.resultssource academy: 24,000/24,000 (xp)studios: 3/3 + [effort not released] (full attendance)reflection attendance: 9/9 reading

level 24 to get the full 18%, you can choose to do more quests in order to gain extra xp for cs 1010 r, which is a graded 1 mc module. personally i think it is not worth it tho lol.as a tryhard y 1 cs student, i did all of the quests and missions up until half of sem 1. at the end of this period, i already had enough xp and exceeded level 24. so the moral is, if you do not want to do cs`1010 r, just pace yourself throughout the mod, there is no need to rush out all the quests and contests.i also stopped doing reflection sheets halfway through because i was lazy, though i don't recommend this because some reflection sessions are quite important. however, i do advise that you do your studio sheets, because your ta will get you to present answers in class and this counts towards your participation xp, which counts towards your 18%. no need to get all your answers correct, as long as you have something to present its good enough.toughest parts of this mod is probably orders of growth,  meta circular evaluator (mce) and maybe environment model. mce is fortunately not a major part of this mod, but environment model is (tested a lot for ra 2, finals), same for orders of growth

where you sit down and explain to your ta what you learnt, almost everyone gets full marks for this.honestly i think this module is pretty important, sets your foundation for cs in general, quite

introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing. starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. the module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. topics covered include: functional abstraction, rec*rsion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.expected grade: b+actual grade: b+this is where it all begins! it's a very unusual module due to how much effort they put into making this. there's an entire full stack application with a video player, game, art, autograder, and ide. the homework sets are called ""missions"" and ""quests"" (you can brag about that in front of non-cs students, even though they are really painful to solve) and the tas are called avengers (mostly y 2 and y 3 cs students who have been through the module).the content teaches you programming from the beginning, and by ""beginning"", it really does start from the very beginning. lecture 1 is on expressions and statements, such as 3 + 2. when i got frustrated doing my missions, i looked back a little at these things and it was a reminder of how far i had come, not that it really helped to quell my frustration. but right afterwards they dump you right into the deep end by introducing rec*rsion and higher-order functions. it was painful doing some of the homework at the start, since the coding that i had learnt by myself before the module started had given me a few bad habits. they adapted the course from mit, except that in mit you have to say ""+ 3 2"" instead of ""3 + 2"", so the module would not be easy by any measure except that the programming language is less convoluted. nevertheless, it's a very solid introduction since the course covers a really wide range of topics, such as computer graphics, sound processing, algorithms and a bit of programming language theory. the original course at mit feels a little like doing toy problems, but here you get to see concrete results of your code, so that you might like coding more by taking this module.the components of the course were semi-cryptically called missions, quests, paths, contests, studios, reflections, mastery checks, and of course, assessments. missions were the main homework that you crack your head open on; quests were optional homework that i gave up quickly on (apparently not all of them are helpful for your understanding); paths were little pieces of homework you check your understanding on. these three components (and other miscellanea) count towards so-called xp which ends up as 18% of your grade. studios were 2 hour tutorials in an 8 student class, taught by an avenger, typically a second or third year student. i quite enjoyed these since there was a lot of room for discussion and such. everyone got to know each other quite well because of the class size, and a team project on a lego robot. reflections were 1 hour sessions to revise the content taught in the lectures, which i find rather helpful since it might not be that easy to really absorb everything that they teach you during the lecture. you get to try some problems as well. mastery checks were interviews with your avenger, where he or she asks you questions and you answer them.with all these, it really helps to build up a solid foundation in code. the effort that the teaching put in is nothing short of amazing.exams and assessmentsof course studying in singapore includes tests - a great way to pit oneself against a cohort of hyper-competitive high scorers. gamified learning alone wouldn't be asian enough.first was a reading assessment where have to read terrible code with the most horrific of styles and many lambda functions squished together into one. each year's paper was harder than the previous one, so i did the first ever paper and i scored ok. right afterwards i jumped into the deep end, which was the 2020/21 one and i failed it. not that i really knew what i was doing, so the mark was definitely deserved.mid-terms and finals involve coding on paper since it supposedly makes you think more. for me, almost the same story for mid-terms as well - just below median. to be fair, it wasn't as bad as i thought due to the sheer number of geniuses present in the course, and some of them might enjoy these things more than me.reading assessment 2 was a quite disastrous since i didn't really internalise the material as well as the others, so when they gave horrific programs for me to draw out the environment model, i flopped terribly.the practical exam was surprisingly manageable, since i didn't have much expectations after doing the questions from the previous years. the autograder crashed when it graded our responses, since one of the questions involved running a quadratic time algorithm on a linked list of 67579 strings. (i heard nus runs on pretty outdated architecture so that was expected after all.)perhaps i'm just bad at understanding the content, but i panicked quite a lot for the finals, and didn't quite know how to do a lot of the questions. good luck to me!overall, they say it's one of the best modules you'd get to take in nus, so please make sure you treasure your time learning this stuff. if you get stuck on something, ask for help since the teaching team is huge; make sure you understand as much as you can since the basics are always important.addendum (august 2022): finals turned out to be just fine, though there was a fair share of difficult questions. one semester after this module, i still don't quite know how to solve some of the problems.[see my other module reviews

once you get it, it is easy game. this module introduced source language, which is javascript but simpler, and the weekly assignments they give on source academy is great for understanding the concept

source academy start off easy, then it gets crazy and you wonder why you have no time left. quests are optional but can help you form deeper understanding in the concepts learnt. reading assessments, midterms and finals have tricky questions that test your true understanding of the topics (these generally have some sort of format so you can somewhat prepare beforehand). mastery checks are kind of like interviews with your ta where he grill you about some concepts and see whether you are fit for the job. practical assessment is the stressful one where you have to code on the spot (practise online with kattis, google kickstart or smth, see their questions then code in source playground).experience: 10/10 i’m a masochist so this journey of pain and suffering is great. jokes aside, i enter with limited knowledge in coding (tried my hands on cs 50 before uni, dabble a bit into python), so i had a lot of fun seeing the concepts turning into practical usage. but like many reviews out

assessmentthe infamous introductory mod to programming for computer science students.for those without any prior experience you're in for a hard time, as this is probably one of the more intensive mods cs students will be taking in their first semester. you will be expected to always be on your toes as there will be a constant stream of assignments and assessments spread out throughout the semester, so it would be wise to keep up with lectures (yes they are webcasted) as content will come and go quickly. playing catch up is no fun as there are rarely breaks in this module.i'd say the most important concepts you'll learn in this mod would be recursion and abstraction. focus extra hard on these two because once you properly understand them not only would you be able to abuse them in exams / assessments but it'll likely provide a good foundation for future coding mods. they are rather confusing though so don't think it'll be easy to pick up these ideas, especially if you have no prior experience.that being said there are ways to make sure you keep up. pay attention during reflections and bug the living hell out of your tutors; don't be afraid to ask questions no matter how stupid you think they are. take any chance you get to practice (maybe extra classes, extra assignments (sidequests), online puzzles or most importantly past year papers) just to further drill the content into your head.for those curious about the language used it's a derivative of javascript they call ""source"", some of the syntax might seem weird for those who have learnt other languages but no worries it won't take long to get used to. the editor and compiler are all on your browser so don't worry too much about using the right os or choosing the right ide.in my experience i found studios to be the most helpful when it came to understanding to content. my tutor in particular was excellent in helping the class revise the content from lectures and encourage us to think of different solutions to problems. recursion was probably the largest hurdle for me but once i finally understood how it worked, work became a lot more manageable. i found the lecturers to be great in articulating the content in a way that was beginner friendly and engaging. reflections were also a good opportunity to delve deeper into lecture content and consult tutors after class.3 extra things to note:1. there was a robotics section at one point where you get to program a lego mindstorms robot. it was rather fun and simple but if you want you could take part in an optional competition called sumobot that will net you more xp.2. with enough xp you will be given the opportunity to take an extra 1 mc which will be graded, and you can choose to accept the grade or reject it (drop the 1 mc). the grade is based on how much xp you get from doing quests (extra assignments), submitting your missions early, or taking part in optional competitions. there is no extra work required once you are offered the 1 mc, it's just a matter of if you want that 1 grade to contribute to your cap or not. for more information ask your module coordinator about this.3. as far as i know and from what is said by our lecturers, this mod is not bell curved so don't too worry too much about ""competing"" or anything, just work together with your friends and brave this storm of a mod together. help from your peers can go a long way in a heavy mod like this!those with experience with coding or those with a knack for problem solving will likely find themselves right at home. i for one had minimal experience beforehand (after week 2 or so everything was brand new to me), but managed to find my groove thanks to the support from my tutor and peers. overall despite the rather heavy workload i enjoyed this mod a lot, and found discussing ideas with friends to be very helpful in further enhancing my understanding.desired grade: aexpected grade (after the last exam): a+actual grade: a+see

assignments also kind of expose us to different kind of application of programming like in music, graphic transformation, robotics, etc.personally, one thing that i think it's the most important and was introduced at the start of the module is wishful thinking. it's really important to understand this concept cuz it will save you a lot of time when writing recursions or iterations. my personal interpretation on this is you wish that the smaller problem can be solved by a certain tool, which in most case is the function which you are currently building a recursion inside, then by calling the function on the smaller size problem you would have solve all the smaller problems. then just use the result, which is the function call on the problem which its problem size is smaller by 1 step, to complete your entire recursion. you just wish that the smaller problem can be solved by a certain tool (which has to exist, if not, make one) and you don't have to understand how it exactly solve your entire problem which its problem size may be quite big. you can first start off with a small problem size and then build a recursion to deal with it. it's easier to understand how your recursion work when dealing with a smaller problem size. try to google to really comprehend what it means. i personally think that the article on wishful thinking by c 2 wiki is not bad.another thing is abstraction. personally i have two interpretations on this. one is when doing the missions, tutorials or any form of assessments, you just have to know what does the given functions can do and don't have to know how it works cuz trying to understand how it works exactly can take up a lot of time. another take is when doing programming, if you find that you are repeating a piece of code for quite a number of times, try to 'abstract' it away, meaning that to put it in a function which you can easily use the functionality again by calling the function or build a recursion or iteration.there is no fixed way in solving a problem, so just use the one that you are comfortable with. also, start off by building a solution that works first, then improve from there.to conclude, even if this mod is challenging, don't simply give up on it, put in effort, try your best, and work smart. you should be proud of how hard you work.all the best to those who gonna take this mod!see more 00 replyshare ›show more

kinda like a love-hate relationship. that really depends on how much effort you intend to put in. unlike most reviewers here, i wouldn't say that this module is only for those with programming background. granted, a programming background would make things much easier, but in the end, it all boils down to: effort and willingness to learn. if you aren't the person who blindly follows and is willing to understand why you should do something in a certain manner and also, broaden your knowledge in topics that might not have to cover in cs 1010, this course is the one for you. :) the effort you put in would depend on your interest in the module and that i believe, is key to the decision.expected grade: a-final grade: a+see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+yyuchuan 9 years agomodule taken in ay 15/16, taught by prof. martin henz and dr. low kok-limif i could, i would rename this course as cs 1101 s: tryhard methodology.if you're a competitive person by nature, this course will use up all your spare time. and even some time you didn't know you had. of course, it also provides a lot of learning opportunities both within the syllabus and also in the topics introduced tangentially that serve as excellent jumping-off points for additional research.if you're only concerned about the grade, the only things that actually matter are your main missions (22 in total, spread out across the semester though often due at inconvenient times. in particular, the last 3 assignments were due on consecutive days right around the time final projects from other modules were due), tutorial participation(though generally showing up should be sufficient), midterm, practical exam, and final exam.

complexity, memoization, and oop, to name a few. along with tutorials, the module comprises of recitations, which are similar to tutorials except for the fact that they are taken by the professors.i will echo the sentiments of some of the other authors on this page by urging you to take this module only if you have prior programming experience. the pace of the module is extremely fast, and is in my opinion, not suited for those new to programming. the workload is intense, and incredibly time-consuming, but the knowledge you gain from this module will almost certainly help you in the long run.professor henz ensures that his lectures are interesting, and does a fairly good job of explaining concepts and ideas. professor kok lim on the other hand, can be very boring at times, and things tend to become problematic when he is delegated the role of explaining difficult topics. the fact that the professors spend very little time on topics(they cover difficult topics like the interpreter in the span of a week) also adds to the pressure of having to understand the topics on your own. notwithstanding that, the module does have it's moments, such as the interesting projects and problem sets, most notably the assignment that involves programming a lego mindstorm robot and the contest that follows.the entire module is presented as a game, where one completes missions(problem sets) and side quests(problems that don't count to your grade) in order to level up and compete with each other on a leaderboard. completion of all the side quests to a reasonable degree of perfection also provides you with an extra mc credited next semester, in the form of 1010 r.all in all, i would recommend this module to any cs major looking to challenge him/herself. however, please think twice if

that he prefers people without prior programming experience, as they are clean slates. heck, even the prerequisites section states ""no programming or computer science experience is required"". but all this means is that you will be learning a new style of programming (functional programming) that you may not have seen before. and if you have prior experience with languages like ruby/js, you have probably seen a bit of it before.coming in fresh means that you will have to pick up knowledge of syntax from the bnf definitions in the jedscript week n definition instead of in a more natural manner. i have seen students struggling with basic concepts like writing if-statements, only to have recursion and iterative vs recursive processes thrust into their face in the second week of the semester.however, the thing about cs 1101 s is that it is an excellent exposure module. the workload is heavy (seriously, you will be cursing at the 3 missions that are due on consecutive days which conveniently happen to fall on the midterms week; you will wonder why you ever signed up for cs 1101 s when your friends in cs 1010 are having it easy), but it is all worth it. you wil be exposed to fractal and curve generation, rsa encryption, robotics and ai while learning the concepts of functional programming.the module is taught in jediscript, a restricted subset of javascript. variables will initially be immutable, while you learn about recursion and iterative and recursive processes. you will learn tail-recursion and deferred operations. you will learn θ-notation and the notion of time and space complexity. you will learn the substitution model of execution. you will learn about pairs and how they are used to recursively construct lists. you will learn the map, accumulate and filter functions. suddenly, variables will become mutable. you will learn the environment model of execution, as the substitution model breaks down. you will learn how to construct circular lists using the set_tail function, as well as other esoteric data structures. you will learn a little bit of oop and then be exposed to lazy evaluation and stream processing. after that, the hardest part of the module comes, which is digging into the interpreter. you will learn how to modify and extend the jediscript interpreter such that it accepts a slightly different language or processes it in a different way. to cap off the module, you will learn familiar-looking constructs (if you have prior programming experience) like while and for loops, and finally html 5!somewhere in the midst of all that, there will be the legendary sumobot contest, where you build a robot using whatever skills you have learnt. the sumobot event itself is a fun evening full of jokes and laughter, and is an experience to remember. martin henz showed up in a darth vader consume that day. xdthe missions are hard, but fun and eye-opening, so i recommend taking them seriously.grade: a<tl;dr> i strongly recommend this module for all cs freshmen, but please please please learn some basic programming (preferably in js, but it doesn't really matter) before coming in. also, ideally, get some experience in functional programming by learning a language like scheme (it's really easy to learn!!!) before coming in, so that you don't freak out when you find out how lists are defined in jediscript.

terminologytutorial: studiorecitation: reflectionta: avengeryou: cadet(yes, this module is space-themed)overvieweven though the first piece of homework is to write a comment, do not be fooled as the difficulty scales exponentially. cs 1101 s dives deep into functional programming in the first few weeks using a substitution model in a programming language called source. you're not allowed to use mutable variables and there is a deep emphasis on recursive methods to solve problems. you will also be exposed to new data structures such as pairs (which are similar to linked lists). after midterms, the module introduces mutable variables using a newly learnt environment model. you will also be using arrays and streams in addition to lists. you get a taste of leetcode by learning basic searching and sorting algorithms. the module concludes with a really really useless topic called metalinguistic abstraction and some bonus lectures.workloadextremely high (felt like 8-12 mc module).lectures are completely virtual, 2 hours, twice a week. the wednesday lecture is the main session while friday's ""brief"" is meant to teach concepts in greater detail. all lectures are recorded.studio sessions are 2 hours per week and in groups of 8. they are run by avengers, who are undergraduates who have taken the course before. there is a usually a studio sheet to be filled up before class. your avenger will usually recap the past week's worth of lectures, followed by go through the homework solutions. thereafter, there are in-class studio sheets to be completed. they can be quite challenging. after every studio session, your tutor will award xp online based on how well you performed during the session.reflection sessions are 1 hour per week, conducted by a more experienced avenger or a professor. there is also a reflection sheet to be done, and it will be gone through in class. the reflection sessions really helped to solidify concepts for me. my avenger, eldric liew, is highly knowledgeable in the field. he often stays back to answer my queries and he is great at explaining difficult concepts intuitively for me to understand them better.as for homework, there are 3 categories of work to be submitted, all on the online source academy platform. paths were simple questions (usually mcq or short code snippets) for you to recap lecture content. missions were the main homework, and it can get really tough at times. the missions often involve a few successive programming questions which build on one another. depending on your competency, you may take either 10 minutes or a weekend to complete it. after submission, your avenger will mark it and xp will be granted to you accordingly. note that you can get more xp if you submit paths and missions early. finally, for the braver cadets, quests are designed to really push the limits of your understanding (the most famous quest being functional expressionism). do not be too alarmed if you cannot do some of them. the professors have reassured us that if you complete all paths and missions adequately, you will achieve the required 24000 xp needed to obtain full marks for the 14% source academy component.examinationsreading assessments (ra) are fully mcq. ra 1 will introduce you to the most cancerous of code snippets where you must code-trace and generate an output. the answers are often very tricky. ra 2 focuses on the environment model and you will have to draw the corresponding model yourself before you can answer the subsequent mcq questions. i did poorly for ra 2 because i drew some of my environment models wrongly and that led to the downfall of multiple questions thereafter.the practical assessment (pa) is a 1 hour 40 min online paper where you code solutions to a few problem sets. the questions often scale in difficulty. a good thing about the pa is that you can run your code on a few public test cases provided. however, do ensure your code compiles as you will be graded fully on the private test cases.midterms and finals are pen-and-paper closed-book exams but allow one double-sided a 4 cheat sheet. the questions can be pretty challenging and new data structures (building on the ones you learn in lectures) are often implemented. however, the professors will upload the suggested solutions for the past few years so you can practise and get a sensing of the paper's difficulty.there are also 2 mastery checks which are recorded zoom sessions with your avenger for you to summarise what you have learnt. your avenger will ask you some follow-up questions too to check your understanding of the concepts. everyone gets full marks for these.tipsthe amount of resources put in by the teaching team is insane for this module. hence, do seek help by attending consultations or messaging your avenger if you have any doubts. do not skip lectures and ensure you do not fall behind in terms of content, as it can pile up really quickly. i would advise you to make a cheat sheet as you go along so you can reference it during exams.most importantly, enjoy yourself! the missions and quests often utilise interesting packages like runes, sounds and curves. you will be able to see or hear the results of your code. furthermore, you get to use a unique ide all from the comfort of your browser (unlike other cs 1010 variants). side note: safari is not supported as of now.overall gradesra 1: 18/19 (median: 15/19)midterms: 96/100 (median: 73/100)ra 2: 37/60 (median: 35/60)pa: 80/80 (median: 51/80)finals: 91/100 (median: ???)everything else: full

CS2030S,"This course is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc."," −+specops 20133 years agoplayhide...see more 100 replyshare ›show more replies −+luna 2 years agoeditedcs 2030 s: programming methodology iiay

programmingstreamsparallelism/concurrencytl,dr: there’s are many good reasons that a fair number of reviews on this site warn against taking this course in sem 1. prof adi is overworked and it shows. he is nice and makes an effort to teach, but honestly i find that the resources he provides (notes, qna, etc) do better for me than actually listening to his lectures. the rest of the teaching team (especially adhy, but also the tas) are enthusiastic, approachable and very willing to help. the content does have a learning curve to it, not unlike cs 1010/1101 and variants, so if that’s what you’re coming from prepare for another round of it. earlier topics might be more painful initially, but most people do get the hang of things later on, and i found that i could get away with a less thorough (conceptually) but broader (in terms of application) understanding of later topics. labs have to be a priority, if not you’ll really struggle later on, while recitation/problem sets are great for revision.thoughts on parts of the course:lectures (2 h/week, recorded): prof adi is enthusiastic but ultimately not a great teacher. he puts in effort into his lecture slides to make them somewhat engaging, and tries to explain things, but i felt that he just was not good at breaking down the more abstract concepts. he moved too fast in general, but particularly for the later parts of the course (post-oop). the lectures i learnt most from were the oop lectures, after that i started to get lost and had to rely more and more on re-reading the lecture notes after the lecture to actually understand what went on. in particular for the later lectures on functional programming and streams, it made more sense for me to sit in the lecture, read the notes while he was teaching instead of listening to him, and then ask questions when i got the opportunity. it is good however that he uses piazza and answers questions on it very quickly and frequently.weekly quizzes were a good way to test understanding of the lecture content, and the github lecture notes were excellent in helping with my understanding and doing of the quiz.recitations (1 h/week): the problem sets are not easy, coming from just the lecture content and github notes. expect to spend anywhere from 1-4 hours attempting it before the recitation if you so choose to.adhy is a great tutor. he makes an effort to go slowly so that we can understand how to approach all the problem set questions, which are typically from past year papers. he is both knowledgeable and makes an effort to clarify everyone’s doubts every stop of the way. he is also very friendly and approachable. he probably made cs 2030 s less painful too.labs (2 h/week) + lab assignment (1 - 12 h/week): the actual lab sessions aren’t always the most useful. the tas first start with a mini lab problem, related to the lecture or the lab (or sometimes both), breaking down how to approach it and solve the problem. the mini labs range from somewhat useful for understanding to not even related to that week’s lab assignment, but my tas did put in particular effort to explain them anyway. after that, the tas went through the week’s lab assignment, explaining what the question was and giving a hint or 2, but not the answers or directly spelling out the approaches (obviously). that being said, when i asked questions they were certainly helpful in answering them. the lab assignments on the other hand were a pain and the bane of my existence. there were many difficulties encountered and often it was hard to solve the problem alone. prof adi made it clear from the start that while discussion was allowed, discussion of the exact implementations and showing peers your code directly is strongly advised against and if there is any plagiarism detected it could result in an immediate failure. it was possible to get stuck on many different parts of the lab assignments and resultantly spend multiple hours for a few days in a row to solve it and pass test cases (or sometimes even compile). thankfully, if you can compile and pass the test cases and follow the design specifications, it generally guaranteed full marks or close to full marks. in the later part of the semester, i often found it useful to first try starting on the lab assignment in the morning after it was released by myself first, then going to the lab session to get help from the tas for troubleshooting, compiling and passing test cases. another major complaint was the programming environment. the process of obtaining and submitting assignments involves the soc servers and github classroom, and thus ubuntu and cli were also involved. learning the cli was not too difficult, and while it was possible to copy the lab assignment files to your local machine, do it on your desired ide and then copy them back to the soc servers and submit, it was not advisable as the practical exams had to be done on the soc servers in vim anyway. for those unfamiliar, vim is a silly, backwards and unproductive development environment (is it even an environment?) designed for people who have too much time to learn shortcuts, commands and believe it’s faster to not use a mouse and not move your hands on the keyboard. i’m not one of those people. vim lacks much of the functionality you would expect from a modern development environment such as vscode (or even idle), and is more in line with notepad on windows. i would strongly encourage enabling mouse support and line numbers the moment you start using vim. the process of using the school servers can sometimes be a bit inconvenient too - you need to use a vpn even in the terrace, the connection can crash and the server can freeze. needless to say, it was not an enjoyable or efficient experience learning to program in vim and i personally will be avoiding it as much as i can after this course.ps: try to get close to full marks in the first 6 lab assignments. then you can choose to not finish lab 7 (it’s extremely long and where people get caught for plagiarism allegedly) and not touch lab 8 (it’s due right before pe 2 but not tested for pe 2).midterms: prof adi themed it with one piece (the anime). it wasn’t easy but also wasn’t too difficult, and the past year practices did somewhat help with preparation for the assessment. it did feel tough while doing the paper, but my results were in line with what i had gotten from the past year papers, and the class average was also about the same as previous semesters. not a whole lot to say here, except for an annoying number of typos, the fact that it was conducted in the mpsh and the clocks not visible to everyone easily, and the surprising fact that the marking scheme was not finalised till more than a week after the paper.pe 1: this felt a bit lazy, mainly because the format of the paper was identical to that of the previous semester’s pe 1. that also meant that the past year papers did prepare me well for pe 1, and i was able to do pretty much everything i needed to other than pass the test cases (but design was still 10 out of 15 marks). that being said, it was mostly manageable albeit with a lack of time and the fact that the penalty for non-compilation of code was only 75% instead of the 100% in previous semesters probably provided some with consolation. however, the pe took far too long to be graded, only being returned about a week or so before pe 2.pe 2: this was a bloodbath. while again it was somewhat similar in format on first glance to the previous semester’s pe, so much to the point that prof had forgotten to change some of the mentions of the file names on the question paper, it felt substantially harder. the requirements to create immutable classes were silly and overly restrictive in a nonsensical way that contradicted what had been taught before and the answer scheme for the past year paper (where the suggested answer shown of creating immutable classes would not be accepted for this sem). the use of streams was not complicated in theory, but it seemed to be assessing more the ability to traverse and navigate data structures and encapsulation than the use of streams, monads/functors, lazy/maybe, infinite list or nested classes which were also supposed to be tested. it seemed like a huge waste of time, with the difficulty being in how tedious it was to navigate said data structures, rather than any of the other topics. is this still cs 2030 s?finals: this was perhaps more balanced, though some small elements of the ‘execution’ of the exam could be better. it was different in format from previous years, 2 semester before being almost all mcq, and the semester before being mostly mcq and mrq with a little of bit of open ended. this year, there were 6 mcq questions (some of them being rather obscure however), and 6 mrq questions (where there were 6 options but at least the question paper stated that partial marks would still be given for partially correct answers, unlike courses like cs 1231 s). there were a few open-ended questions (mostly short answer, except at the end where justification was required for whether code would compile or a given class was a monad) were somewhat manageable and predictable in what they ask (given previous years’ papers), and overall the paper was doable. it tested topics from start to end of the course, with some earlier topics (that were already tested in midterms) taken up a notch in complexity, obscurity or difficulty. others, like monads or infinitelist, were thankfully not any more complex than previous years’ papers or the problem sets gone through during recitations. overall, the paper was doable without too many surprises, though i could not be certain of many of my answers.see more 30 replyshare ›show more replies −+ccs dog 24 days agotough mod but learned a lotpe 0:1%(bonus if u didnt get 100% on pe 1 and pe 2)pe 1:15%pe 2:25%midterm:20%final:30%quiz:5% (can

across right now. it is tough. period. even more so if taken during semester 1. you will know just by looking at the past year papers (pyps). please do keep my name (op’s name) in mind when reading the review as it is a very big contextual clue on my abilities as someone with some form of computing background. i understand that i am going against the grain here with my review so do take my review and others with a healthy pinch of salt. ymmv if you take this course.module workload (weekly)- the weekly quizzes is usually doable because of the unlimited attempts given. if you know the content for the week, you can often finish it in an hour. if not then expect to spend about 2 - 3 hours trying different combinations of answers for the questions since they are mcqs and mrqs (multiple response questions).- the weekly pes are a killer. the time required to complete it can span from a few hours to a few days, depending on your proficiency in the concepts (and also chatgpt skills), as it can be long, unclear and frustrating to complete it. the longest time that i spent was honestly the whole week. sounds absurd but i really did spend that long on it because i just could not figure it out.- i did not attempt the tutorials before recitations so i cannot give an accurate estimate of the time required but they are usually questions from pyps or specific questions created for your understanding. depending on your ta, you may or may not understand the content, based on my experience attending all recitations.lecture- it can be extremely engaging to dozing off boring kind. prof adi is passionate at times but the passion do not translate into good explanation skills. it may be because he knows the subject matter well so it’s hard to explain things. here’s an example to illustrate my point. try to explain why 1 + 1 = 2. it’s tough right? because you’re so used to it that you find it difficult to explain. in this case, sometimes prof adi’s simple explanation isn’t really simple or easy to follow. it requires certain knowledge to understand and when you do not know what you do not know, it can become a problem. this issue appears multiple times during lectures. sometimes it is better to just read the notes given on github pages instead of listening to the lecture. however, the downside to that is you will miss the live coding examples. the helpfulness of it is questionable because it is very easy to get overwhelmed and side tracked. you lose focus for a sec and you will be lost, rendering the whole thing more confusing. in my opinion, the time used for it will be better off used in breaking down the concepts because you need to understand the concept to code, not understand the code to know the concepts. the slides are bare bones i.e there are more graphics than words. it is honestly not useful at all to me but you may find it useful?recitation- my ta was a new phd student teaching, not prof adi. at times, the ta can be unclear, perhaps because it is his first time teaching recitations, but he does try his best to explain since he was a student before. recitations are only an hour long and sometimes i leave with more doubts than answers. google is your best friend!practicals- i have to say that practicals are done counter-intuitively? the practical session is 2 hours long and has a review of the past week’s pe and some mini lab exercises to be done before the week’s pe is introduced to us. there is nothing much to say about the mini labs because they are easy and do not represent the difficulty of the weekly pes. during the review of the past week’s pe, the explanation of the code given is extremely surface level and this is an issue especially since the focus shifts to functional programming in the second half of the semester. for my session, my lab tas simply showed us the sample code and explained the abstract idea of it, probably because of instructions given to them. it does not go into why a particular line of code is used over another. you are expected to figure out why yourself. hence the counter-intuitiveness of it, you made a mistake but you’re not told why it is a mistake. you have to figure out why yourself but if you knew why it is a mistake then you would not have done it that way right? as other reviewers have mentioned, negative marking is used so you need to know why to not repeat the mistake / progress to the next pe. the feedback given is extremely disappointing because learning requires good feedback. you need to know what and where you went wrong to learn and improve. practicals should be a good way for students to learn since it is hands on coding but the lack of good feedback on your progress hampers the usefulness of it. it becomes a mundane chore to do because you do not know why you’re even there since you’re not really learning much anyway. again, google / chatgpt is your friend.exams / practical assessments- expect them to be more difficult than semester 2. i imagine the increased difficulty is because they can afford to do so. picture failing 450 out of 900 cs year 1 students in semester 2. this will become an infinitelist of backlogs. since semester 1 has lesser students (~ 250 - 300) , the impact will not be as big. time is a really big issue for the assessments. you do not have time to think which is strange given that semester 1 questions require more thinking than semester 2 questions. you need to know the concepts extremely well. it would be best if you could be the java compiler + java virtual machine combo! no kidding.my general review- this module is very messy in terms of content. the object oriented programming part in the first half of the semester is easy to understand but the functional programming part in the second half is just downright confusing because the core ideas are not taught well. examples are map, flatmap, monads and functors etc. ironically, the not well explained topics / concepts are the ones that come out in exams. since things move like a bullet train in university, not understanding your current lecture will impact your learning. unfortunately, this module just does not give good feedback / explanantion to assist you in your learning. you’re better off on the internet asking strangers for help than the teaching team (that you pay for with your tuition fees). the teaching methods of this module should be revamped since it is a core module that students will rely on. the methods of testing knowledge should be changed to be more comprehensive and cumulative. these weightages for assessments and exams though cumulative do not serve students well given the poor teaching done. they merely compound stress on the student. prof adi mention that the weekly pes are a way to push students to understand. i disagree. yes, i can see the potential of it but once again the teaching just does not do it any good. at the end of the semester, i am still not quite sure what i was supposed to learn from this module. java? different programming paradigms? good google / chatgpt skills? i will leave it up to you to decide.you will feel angry, disappointment, sadness and maybe joy if the module is taken in semester 1. this module is not a level playing field. it is very much high risk high reward but that is something you have to accept if you decide to take the module in semester 1. smaller cohort numbers mean you can get as easily as compared to semester 2. however that means you’re also more likely to fail. i will provide a simple decision flow on whether to take this module in semester 1. do you want to do an easy paper, pass the module and move on? if so, take it in semester 2. otherwise, if you are really confident in your abilities or you just want to take a gamble for that a, go ahead and take it in semester 1 but be warned of what you may face. for all other cases, especially for poly students given cs 1010 / cs 1101 s exemptions, take it in semester 2. you will thank me later.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+ddong zhu! buxu zou!a year agoay 2023/24 semester 1 lecturer: adi yoga sidi prabhawaassessment 5% self-diagnostic

provided to be quite comprehensive.labsthere are weekly lab assignments which are going to take up a significant portion of your time. it is a good idea to always discuss with your friends to make sure that you have not made any errors in your logic. you want to maximise your marks here as much as possible as most people would get close to full marks for all the labs.recitationsi did not do the recitation problem sets beforehand, but i found that listening to the tutor go through the questions was always very helpful in clarifying the concepts for me. recitations are also a good chance to ask questions, and i would highly recommend that you attend them.overall:i thought the content covered in this course was somewhat interesting (though less so compared to cs 2040 s). for those unfamiliar with using vim, the combination of trying to learn vim and having to slog through the weekly lab assignments would probably be quite painful. even as someone who really enjoyed cs 1101 s, i did not particularly like this module, but ymmv. the biggest challenge i experienced for this module was with the ambiguity involved in answering the questions (especially the open-ended ones)!for the theory side, attempting past year papers can be quite helpful for the learning process. it exposes you to the many idiosyncrasies of java. the coursemology forum was also extremely useful, as the professors and tas are quite active in answering questions there. i often find concepts that i misunderstood or was completely unaware of by reading through the forum.for the practical, some tips i have are:- take note of how much time you have left (my invigilator did not write the start and end time).- don't touch your code in the last 5 minutes(code that could not compile would receive 0 for the entire assessment).- bring your own keyboard (if possible)! typing speed matters to some extent during the practical, so you should try to maximise every advantage you can get.lastly,print out all the materials you need! the assessments are completely open-book, and you will only be kicking yourself if you realise halfway through the exam that the answer to a question is from a section that you forgot to print out.expected grade: a-/asee more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+kkinggobslayer 2 years agotaken in ay 22/23 sem 1.professor: adi yoga sidi prabawaworkload: 1 x 2-hour lecture, 1 x

although in his defence he had to change many labs because it was discovered that someone in our cohort managed to get answers for the labs from the previous semester. overall a fairly enjoyable module, and i don't fault prof adi for some issues along the way, as he is genuinely a nice person and his passion while teaching makes the dry subject matter a bit more tolerable.diagnostic quizzes: nothing much to say, pretty much a giveaway.pe 1: was way harder than previous years for some reason, most people didn't do that well. upper quartile was 14/30 if i remember correctly.midterm exam: the theory was fairly easy, most people did quite well.pe 2: not sure how everyone else did. pe 2 is supposed to be the harder one, but i did much better.final: the theory was super tricky, not sure

effort into his lecture slides, just that sometimes he assumes you know the content before-hand, which makes his explanations not-so-comprehensible. i believe next semester the original profs are coming back so perhaps things may become better.content-wise it can broken down into 4 main parts: oop, fp, streams, and concurrent/parallel computations. midterms and pe 1 tested oop and some fp, i feel like the only way to do well is to practice consistently, especially for oop. pe 2 tested on more-fp and streams, whereas finals tested everything. pe 1 was tougher for most people than pe 2 including myself.make sure you understand every topic well before the finals, if not they will come back to haunt you. i think i messed up the finals pretty badly because i had gaps in some topics. i felt that the few concurrency topics were pretty scattered and unrelated to the rest so hopefully the department can remove them in future.hopefully cs 2040 s and cs 2100 will be less tiring than

shambolic to say the very least. it is taught poorly, and the labs, assignments and general content had quite a number of mistakes.i would like to preface my review by stating that lecturer adi is probably overworked like the majority of educators in the industry, in addition to the fact that he has a family and kids to look after. he also caught covid during the course of the module and was also sick for an additional week or two. from what i can gather, he also genuinely cares for the students.the experience i had in this module was unpleasant and unenjoyable. there was a lot of needless suffering and the content could be taught, and applications shown in so many more efficient and engaging ways. some of the labs simply throw you into the deep end and i would have straight up become deceased if not for the fact that i was taking this module with friends who have been of great assistance, in addition to my godly tas.pe 1, pe 2 and finals were conducted in the utown auditorium. i am not going to speculate about the choice of location, but all i can say that it was definitely not conducive to hold a coding practical exam in. the only silver lining was that since the table could only fit your laptop, nobody was able to utilise their external keyboards.highlight of this module would be wrecking my mental health in an attempt to submit the 2 particularly insane labs by the tuesday deadline after pe 1 and pe 2 on saturday respectively.the tas for my lab were both of great assistance during the lab sessions.i would not have made it through this semester if not

labs (no project this semester)description: this module is a follow up to cs 1010. it explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.difficulty rating: 8/10 enjoyment rating: 4/10 expected grade: b-actual grade: b (practical exam 2 saved me - i elected to take it in person, and there was an entire classroom of us to joke about the ludicrous situation)this is a core module that has a mixed reputation amongst the cohort, and unfortunately i succumbed to the challenge, presumably scoring below the 25 th percentile for all but one of the assessments. i am not sure about the takeaways from such a class, however important object oriented programming is.prof ooi coordinated the module, and dr anderson taught the lectures, thankfully quite adequately. tas for recitations were graduate tutors, and for labs, undergraduate students who appear to be quite apt for the task.a certain member of cs 1101 s's teaching team refuses to teach this module, telling me that cs 2030(s) has not been revamped in a decade. this left the students with a number of questionable assignments and strange choices in the design of the course. vim was essentially the only permitted text editor; you would have to ssh into the school machines using vim during the two practical exams. understandably, vim has a good reputation in professional circles, and the indispensability of the command line cannot be understated, but the users of stackoverflow seem to prefer intelligent ides, at least for languages with much boilerplate like java.the course also tried to fit in quite a bit of content sometimes taught in separate modules in other universities, including object oriented design, the intricacies of java with its type system, functional programming using functional interfaces in java (i really hope no one does this in real life), and a little bit on parallelism. with so much content, the pace of the module felt as fast as that of cs 1101 s.the first 3 labs were on object oriented design, requiring the creation of a toy system to simulate a shop - exactly the sort of thing you would expect from a course no one bothered to update. the principles of writing code in a readable and refactorable manner were quite confusing at first, as it was extremely tempting to hack the code until it worked. after that, much of the class was on generics and functional programming with toy programs again, which meant that i forcibly tried whatever permutations i could think of to pass the test cases, instead of stepping back and thinking about the right code to write. the penultimate lab was on streams or ""infinitelists"" as the course preferred to call it, and it was a huge pain even with two weeks to write under 100 lines of code. it did not help that vim does not provide any hints either.as a natural extension to the labs, practical exams required the rapid-fire completion of code similar to that of the lab assignments. these were done online in my semester, delicately crafted so that most students would not be able to finish the entire task. interestingly, uncompilable code would be given a big fat zero, and quite a number of people, including the otherwise high-achieving ones, might fall into this very trap. a certain member of the discord server told the horror story of submitting an otherwise perfect program, but only getting a single mark out of 25 because of a compilation error.right before the second practical exam, the school of computing servers crashed, and everyone went through an arduous two hour wait before seeing the two hour exam shortened to a singular hour. thankfully, the teaching team was able to resolve most of the problems related to grading this exam without much of an uproar.at the same time, quite many theoretical concepts such as dynamic binding, stack and heap diagrams or parallel processes were introduced. these were not too easy to get my head around, and added quite a little to the pressure close to examination periods. content tested on the theory exams were not too similar to that of labs or practical exams, which meant extra worrying about ideas that i had thought i understood well until the exam revealed the gaping holes in my knowledge.2 hour lab sessions and 1 hour recitation sessions were conducted face to face in my semester - labs mostly included going through the previous weeks' errors, as well as sprinkling a microscopic selection of hints for the next lab, usually proving woefully inadequate. recitations taught the theoretical oddities of java, and as the semester progressed, fewer and fewer people attended the sessions in person, as recordings were all put online and no attendance was taken.all in all, the module might need some overhauling, though the content taught are clearly very useful. it also brought me a fair bit of doubt about my level of understanding concepts as compared to others in the cohort. perhaps for the next module in the series, cs 2103 t software engineering, i might have to prepare myself a little beforehand since design does not seem to be the focus in this module. i hope the idea of a type system has been drilled into my system (i can't be sure), since quite a lot of important languages do look at types.[see my other module reviews athttps://spergiemcsperglord....]see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+zhao wei liew 3 years agoeditedtaken in ay 21/22

learning all these, but the lack of depth made it less enjoyable.professors:i didn't enjoy watching their lectures and ended up solely relying on the lecture notes and the q&a forums. this is mostly

flexible, and scalable. the language we used was java, so it's not a bad idea to take this mod at the same time as cs 2040 s. the topics covered included oop, data hiding, generics, typing, nested and local classes, lambdas, streams, lazy evaluation, monads, asynchronous programming, and parallel programming. the content was personally not interesting but it is definitely useful for coding in general. it starts off fairly simple but topics like generics, lazy evaluation, and asynchronous programming can get very confusing.lectures would have the profs go through the topics and show examples using programs. they were ok but not enthralling and the profs were a bit monotone. however, the profs are very responsive on piazza and it's a great place to clarify any questions you have.aside from lectures, we also had recitations and labs. for recitations, we were given a worksheet with questions beforehand. then, in the recitation class itself, the ta would go through the worksheet. attendance isn't compulsory iirc but i'd recommend going anyway since they can help clarify any misunderstandings you have with the topic. the worksheets are short with only 3-4 questions and you aren't required to complete them so the recitations add little to the workload. they're also only an hour long. labs i'll cover in the next section.important!!in this mod, we were required to ssh into the school computers and use vim in our assessments and labs. i highly recommend learning how to use vim beforehand since it saves you time learning it during the semester. vimtutor is a pretty good tutorial for it, and you should do a bit of actual programming in it to get the hang of it. having some basic knowledge of linux terminal commands is good too.assessment breakdown:labs:

implement a class with certain specified functionality. we were given the specifications, files, the class/method names, and test cases, but we had to code the functionality of the classes and their methods. during the lab sessions, we would meet with the ta who would give us an overview of what we were supposed to do and then leave us to work on the lab on our own. i personally enjoyed these labs but they do take a long time, probably about 3-4 hours each week. like the content, they start off simple but some of them can get very confusing, especially the ones involving lazy evaluation.the practical exams are like the labs but you have to do them in 2 hours which can be pretty stressful. we were allowed printed notes for these. it's a good idea to print out your lab code since sometimes the code you have to write in the practical exams will be similar to the ones you wrote for the lab. practical exam 1 wasn't too bad but most people got destroyed in practical exam 2, including me.the midterm and final exams both allow notes but they had to be printed out even though the exams were online. they start off with mcq questions and then later on become short answer questions with a few short essay questions (like ""explain why...""). these were generally easier than practical exam 2 and nothing difficult if you understood the course content.final grade: a+tl;dr

out of 40. personally i only missed super.tostring() in one of my classes but surprisingly lost 2.5 marks. fortunately the gap can be filled up by my pe 0. got 37.5/40 pe 2 is much easier compared to pe 1, and we were given 2 hr to finish questions that can be done in 40 min. this time the task was to build a naive monad encapsulating programs as functions. then there were also tasks about using stream pipelines, similar to cs 1101 s ra 2 questions. upper quartile is 37/40, which is as expected. got 40/40 midterm:midterm was not difficult but it put your understanding of oop principles under test. we were required to examine the given code snippet and to evaluate if it adheres to oop rules or to predict what will happen during execution (eg compilability & dynamic binding). the stack and heap question caught many off guard because it was the first time (at least in recent years) that exceptions were tested. upper quartile is 51/70. got 64/70 final:this is a tricky paper and i thought i screwed up after walking out of exam venue. the question about intmonad required great understanding of generics and unfortunately i made one mistake in the mcq about wildcard. the open-ended questions were mostly about writing some simple code but the maybe question was quite tricky because one may unwittingly confuse flatmap with map. although upper quartile is only 79/100, the iqr of 20 means most people are getting similar grades (but note this mod is not bell-curved). got 96/100 i would say cs 2030 s is less enjoyable than cs 1101 s, but results are satisfactory and i learnt a lot about writing codes in a human-friendly manner.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+sodium_is_not_a_cata month agoediteday 24/25 sem 2 profs: boyd anderson, ashish deepak dandekar, ooi wei tsangrecitation: boydenjoyability: 4 / 5 workload: 3 / 5 (can be varied depending on past programming experiences)personally, the content of this module was well organized. the community (ed discussion) was very active, and the lecturers were really great (preferably among the best i've taken in y 1). programming exercises were a little bit challenging, but if you know what you are trying to do, it's not that bad. even though it is not compulsory to complete all exercises in this semester, it's still a great exercise for students to familarize students with oop and fp paradigms in one semester. forcing students to use vim was also one of the best decisions in my opinion. although the getting used to it is very hard, it's really worth if you want to code faster.however, the exams and pes hindered me from enjoying this module. the exams (especially midterm) had a lot of typos, and the wrongly implementedminfunction in pe 1 wrecked many students so bad, including me. moreover, the infamous xor question that aimed to test monad can posed unfair advantages for students who knew xor before (either from cs 2100 or other stuffs). even though voiding these questions might seem unfair, i felt the lecturers should have taken more responsibility in setting them or at least conducted a thorough recheck of the exam.expected grade:a-/asee more 00 replyshare

boyd retains his usual teaching style, always using examples of him ""failing"" to implement something to motivate the introduction of new concepts. ashish did some lectures on functional programming. he didn't employ the same theatrics as boyd but he's solid too. wei tsang was just there to answer questions in chat and on ed.content:you can look up the website used for every sem 2 version of 2030 s, which contains all the notes. broadly speaking, we started off learning oop with java, together with concepts like types, generics, and exception handling. the second half focuses on functional programming, where ideas like immutability, pure functions, and monads and functors were taught. you get to see familiar faces like lambda functions and streams too. some parallel computing was also snuck in at the end.workload:weekly -- lab exercise (coding assignment), post lecture quiz and recitation sheet. regarding the lab exercises, before midterm, we were building up a simulation software while adhering to oop principles. post midterm, we built own version of java containers like optional and stream.assessment:ca (10%)pe 0 (1%*) – 26/26 pe 1 (15%) – 27.5/40 pe 2 (25%) – 35/40 midterm

people i know didn't finish pe 1, that seems to be trend. having said that, i know some people who got full marks because. pe 2 is on making stream pipelines. though this sem they had us implement some nested classes with generics too. most people found pe 2 manageable.midterm and final are basically the same style as 1101 s papers, just without the ""problem-solving"" aspect because that's saved for 2040 s, probably. majority mcqs with 1-2 short questions. no actual coding here really, besides reading code.something about type inference: you can think of subtyping (<:) as the less than or equal to relation (≤) from math, so the problem becomes solving inequalities. this (should) work since subtyping is a partial order relation. on that note, might also be useful to think of bounded wildcards in terms of sets hmm.overall, a less impressive and more boring sequel to 1101 s / i am not very good at it.expected grade: a-see more 00 replyshare ›−+iota 113 iota 1133 days agofinal

study the course.so far, the most interesting mod i have taken, coming from someone whose only real coding experience is cs 1101 s and a bit of competitive programming during the winter break. it felt like a fresh thing when all i have done so far is do some write some basic recursions.the exercises were nice, the practices for practical exams were nice, the problem sets given at the end of lectures were nice, it was mostly quite nice. bear in mind that nice doesn't necessarily mean it was completely enjoyable. i spent on 6-7 hours on exercises 1-3 (mostly basic oop and running a system), also around the same time for exercise 4-6, (which focuses on monads), and a whopping 13 hours on exercise 7, which was about implementing infinite lists lazily. i admit that i did need help for the takewhile method after the 12 hour mark, so who knows how long it would have taken had i just tried myself. the main issue was figuring out how to lazily implement the method, which apparently required reference to the maybe class implemented in exercise 5, which somehow flew over my head like a fly. if there's one lesson i learned here, try to be more resourceful when you get stuck at something.as for the midterm, i got 48/70 on the midterms. i made two unforced mistakes, in particular the oop principles such as lsp and information hiding, and one at the heap & stack, which probably cost me ~10 marks. but even then, i was not sure about most of my answers. i feel like this is one of those courses that you will probably doubt your answers on during the exams even if you had finished all the past years and revised several times, so eventually i just studied my best and let things slide once its done.the first practical exam was hard for me. i really struggled to figure out my mistakes, especially for that one method that had a lot of criteria (the compare method asked you to check for 5 properties). then there was this infamous max method that most students including me weren't able to use. i didn't wanna blame the method though, and i was right not to, because one of my friend was able to utilise and hence earned full marks on the exam. fortunately the second practical exam was okay.as for the finals, there was this maybe problem i couldn't do. i struggled with those kinds of questions too during the practical exam, and it resurfaced here. the lesson here is to notice what you aren't good at and try to upgrade that. other than that, same as the midterm; i am not sure for most of my answers.as a final note, one thing i should have done more: ask about what i don't understand during the labs. i abused my right to ask during the later labs, especially the ones discussing monads and completable future, and i only wish i had done that more times before because boy there's a ton of topics covered in this mod.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ssocacademicvictima month agoediteday 24/25 sem 2 profs: boyd anderson and a few others

have no idea. but the teaching staff included profs ooi wei tsang, boyd anderson, ashish dandekar.context: prior to this course, reviewer has not done proper object oriented programming (and no, python does not count).tl;dr pretty tough course, be consistent and at the end of the day, don't forget to pat yourself on the back. good teaching of object oriented programming in that i learnt quite a bit. the introduction to bread-and-butter tools like the command line and unix bash will certainly prove helpful. flip side is that you will have anabsolutelytedious time throughout this course.things you learn:1. oop theory- principles of oop (abstraction, encapsulation, info hiding, tell don't ask, polymorphism, lsp, pecs)- type systems (primitives, classes, wrapper classes, abstract types, interfaces, lambdas)- inheritance & composition as means to extend programs- method resolution (""dynamic binding"")2. bootleg fp (sorry, java is not a pure fp language)- monads & functors (cute little wrapper objects likerust's option type)- java stream operations (""do things with one pipeline only!!!"")3. practical coding (mostly java)- how java manages its memory (stack, heap, metaspace)- java's generic types- how oop principles translate to code that's easier to service, extend, and troubleshoot.- lazy evaluation- introduction to non-sequential programming:- concurrent, asynchronous, and parallel programmingsubjective reviewworkload: 7.5/10 (it takes real conscious effort to stay afloat. the exercises need a lot of planning and coding; therefore they can sometimes take a day or two to do. the upside is your friends are all suffering with you!)enjoyability: 2/10 (subject matter is very contrived. i appreciate the value in learning it, but i honestly cannot say i enjoyed it.)difficulty: 7/10-  pen & paper exams are really mind-twisting and easily exhaust you halfway through.- recent sem 2 practical exams (pes) have you really racing against the clock. they are not conceptually difficult, but don't leave (any) room for you to waffle around and think slowly.- this is in contrast to sem 1 pes, which i heard can be cleared quite quickly despite being more difficult.comments:obligatory cheer because vim and bash are used!!!sorry, but the module is otherwise not at all intrinsically enjoyable.let's... talk about some of the positives first...:- as you can see from above, you learn a lot of concepts which, at least by personal experience, arereallynifty things to have in your back pocket.- you get loads of hands-on time with the exercises.- even for the theory there's loads of help (self-diagnostic quizzes, catch-up sessions etc.)- i had great experiences with recitations! (thanks prof boyd.)sadly, i doubt the negatives are easy fixes...- the elephant in the room here is that java is just a headache-inducing language that has precious little practical use outside of legacy systems. we spend like half our time learning about java's little quirks and intricacies, and it becomesveryhard to know what's transferable to other languages, and what's not. loads of wasted brain cells, if i'll be honest.- the coding experience in this language was also terrible. the debug messages are utterly incoherent and it really forces you to be able to think twice, write once. ""getting things right the first try"" seems to be a running theme of cs courses at this point, but holding yourself to impossible standards like that is probably not going to do you any service... (the rant stops here)- somewhat insignificantly, i felt stuff like generics and dynamic binding were a bit too convoluted to fully internalise, and i don't quite think it's the teaching team's fault either... certainly hurt my enjoyment, but no suggestions from me here...assessment components 1. weekly self-diagnostic quizzes (total 10) - 5%*2. lab sheets (total 5, where you answer questions about the programming exercises, instead of doing them) - 5%*3. pe 0 (warmup, you only get the 1% if you don't score full marks for pe 1 + pe 2) - 1%4. pe 1 (was about applying oop principles.

cheongduring lectures, prof adi goes through a fair share of slides while annotating them, with a decent portion of live coding. he answers questions during lectures as well and rewards you with rubber ducks for spotting mistakes. he is very active on ed, responding to questions in a very timely manner.lectures were on mondays, with weekly self-diagnostic quizzes due on wednesdays, so you could do them after the lecture when you were more comfortable with content. the next week’s content and programming exercise were uploaded on wednesday night, with the programming exercises usually due on tuesdays, giving slightly less than a week to finish them.the problem sets for recitations usually consisted of a few questions along with some past year questions for practice (which were not gone through). i attended recitations, but the answers are uploaded after so it probably wouldn’t have made much difference. brian was my recitation ta, and he would go through concepts and the problem set, answering any questions we had.labs generally involved tas going through the previous week’s programming exercises, such as common mistakes and suggested solutions. after that, they would go through the “mini lab”. “mini lab”s were split into 2 small problems, with the tas live coding one of them, and us given time to finish the other. after that, my tas would call people up to show their solution to the other problem, and finish off by going through the next week’s programming exercise description and giving small hints (no major spoilers ofc). labs sometimes finished earlier than the allocated time, but i wouldn’t count on it.in my opinion the best place to learn from is the lecture notes as the slides are a bit hard to understand without the explanations. the diagnostic quizzes were very useful in checking my understanding, and help to hold yourself accountable. recitations were an accurate representation of questions that could come out during exams. the lab problems were often very simplistic and did not really help my understanding, but the tas going through programming exercises and weekly content did help.i enjoyed this module, with its fair share of theory and practical work to be done. but i did have my fair share of wrestling with java (thank you @override), and there were times it seemed like we were expected to install jdk 21 in our

your understanding. they were unlimited attempts with feedback, so these are free marks you must get, even if you don’t really know what you are doing.programming exercises: 5% (8 exercises, 1% each, capped at 5%)the programming exercises were usually given on a weekly basis, with some of them building on previous week’s work. they can be very time consuming if you aren’t really sure what you are doing, so it might help to discuss with friends. this was explicitly encouraged by prof adi, but you were required to note down who you discussed with in your code. and of course, plagiarism was frowned upon. the exercises are the main source of consistent practice you will get.pa 0: 1% (only used to top up pa 1 and pa 2)we had a mock practical during the labs right before pas, which were a pretty accurate representation of what the actual pa would be like. this is the most realistic warmup you will get, and acted as some sort of last minute indicator of what areas you need to brush up on.pa 1: 15%the focus of this pa was oop, which was tears of the kingdom themed (prof might be having too much fun). we were given 48 hours after the exam to modify code, but only implementation details and not design changes. this basically meant you could only edit method bodies, so the bulk of the work still had to be done during the actual pa. i finished the pa during the allocated time, but unfortunately forgot to write @override on 10 (ten) different methods, dropping my marks quite a bit. familiarity with oop concepts such as inheritance and the java syntax is important, which should be ok if you do the programming exercises.pa 2: 25%the focus of this pa was immutability and streams. the problems are by tasks, each with their own testcases, so they weren’t really interlinked compared to pa 1. do the practice pas to train your functional thinking, and just spam stream methods.midterm: 20%i found the midterms to be pretty tricky, but i feel they were quite lenient in the marking for open ended. prof adi set a jujutsu kaisen themed paper (previous year was one piece), which was quite funny although it meant the class names were a little cancerous to work through (postiveenergy negativeenergy cursedenergy my brain was spinning reading these over and over again). there was a bonus question to reward those who attended lectures.finals: 30%the finals (similar to previous years) had a decent amount of code writing. there was a 9 mark question on implementation with recursivetask, which i think caught many people by surprise (luckily i did the past year paper where this was tested). although i don’t really agree with the suggested answer being like twice the space given i can’t really complain. there were 2 3 x 3 tables of yes and no, with one of them being fully yes, so don’t be like me and question yourself. the mcqs were once again slightly tricky, but there weren’t really any major curveballs. the finals format is usually quite standard, with a bunch of mcqs followed by a monad question, some form of stack and heap, a completablefuture question, and maybe a bit of parallelism.workload: 7/10 enjoyability: 9/10 difficulty:

command line interface very quickly. the early weeks involve building a coffee shop simulation and extending it to incorporate new features, while the later weeks involve building a few monads, which are containers with context: some, maybe, lazy, and infinitelist. i personally found many of the exercises extremely difficult, especially once we reach the part where we are supposed to build these monads, and spent hours on end trying to conjure a code that could make it work, and you should expect to face such an issue as well.pa 0 grades are awarded on the condition that you do not receive full marks for pa 1 & pa 2 combined. the 15-mark, 90 minutes pa 1 aims to test object-oriented programming design by modelling materials within the game, the legend of zelda: tears of the kingdom. it could have been mission impossible, as you have to do a ton of code refactoring within 90 minutes. but thanks to the feedback of previous cohorts, we are allowed to make non-design changes, such as implementing method stubs or adding private methods and fields after the test, which saved the grades of many and put an end to needless hardships.the 25-mark, 120 minutes pa 2 involves candy bags and almost exclusively tests stream processing. since functional programming, and in particular, lambda functions, are involved, it is much less of a typing speed competition, and tests more of your conceptual understanding of how to transform one stream to another. i find it much easier, but because your code must be correct and compilable by the end of the test, i believe many people were penalised.the 60-mark, 60 minutes mid-terms took reference to the jujutsu kaisen manga series, which made the questions and code very wordy and difficult to read compared to past year papers, muddling the subtyping relationships with classes like ""sorcerer"", ""cursedtechnique"" and ""negativeenergy"". in contrast, the 90-mark, 120 minutes finals lacks a storyline and is much easier to read. all 4 aforementioned assessments are closed-book with 1 double-sided a 4 paper allowed as a cheat sheet.conclusioni was a student who took h 2 computing, and exempted myself from cs 1101 s through a placement test. hence, i went into this course without the knowledge that students in cs 1101 s have, which has a rather different way of thinking from how things are done in h 2 computing. i have to admit that halfway through the course, i was almost panicking that i might have made a terrible mistake by proceeding with this move and pitting myself against a high-aptitude cohort filled with computing students from polytechnic who received automatic exemptions, and those who were successful in international competitions. but i managed to be very precise with my code for the practical assessments, which pulled my grades up significantly. it shows the extreme importance of getting your practicals done right for this course.the main reason i was initially struggling was because coming from python back in h 2 computing, i wasn't used to the strong & statically-typed nature of java, and dealing with the typing relationships shenanigans that it has. once the object-oriented programming part of the course comes to an end and we move on to the functional programming part, things became much more intuitive for me. with the benefit of hindsight, i'll say that to do well for the major assessments, it is important that you are clear of the dynamic binding process, type cast checks, the type inference process and stream processing.resultspractical assessment 1: 14/15

highest score will be recorded.all programming is done using the terminal with vim, so you must get used to a command line interface very quickly. the early weeks involve building a coffee shop simulation and extending it to incorporate new features, while the later weeks involve building a few monads, which are containers with context: some, maybe, lazy, and infinitelist. i personally found many of the exercises extremely difficult, especially once we reach the part where we are supposed to build these monads, and spent hours on end trying to conjure a code that could make it work, and you should expect to face such an issue as well.pa 0 grades are awarded on the condition that you do not receive full marks for pa 1 & pa 2 combined. the 15-mark, 90 minutes pa 1 aims to test object-oriented programming design by modelling materials within the game, the legend of zelda: tears of the kingdom. it could have been mission impossible, as you have to do a ton of code refactoring within 90 minutes. but thanks to the feedback of previous cohorts, we are allowed to make non-design changes, such as implementing method stubs or adding private methods and fields after the test, which saved the grades of many and put an end to needless hardships.the 25-mark, 120 minutes pa 2 involves candy bags and almost exclusively tests stream processing. since functional programming, and in particular, lambda functions, are involved, it is much less of a typing speed competition, and tests more of your conceptual understanding of how to transform one stream to another. i find it much easier, but because your code must be correct and compilable by the end of the test, i believe many people were penalised.the 60-mark, 60 minutes mid-terms took reference to the jujutsu kaisen manga series, which made the questions and code very wordy and difficult to read compared to past year papers, muddling the subtyping relationships with classes like ""sorcerer"", ""cursedtechnique"" and ""negativeenergy"". in contrast, the 90-mark, 120 minutes finals lacks a storyline and is much easier to read. all 4 aforementioned assessments are closed-book with 1 double-sided a 4 paper allowed as a cheat sheet.conclusioni was a noi silver medalist who took h 2 computing, and exempted myself from cs 1101 s through a placement test. hence, i went into this course without the knowledge that students in cs 1101 s have, which has a rather different way of thinking from how things are done in h 2 computing. i have to admit that halfway through the course, i was panicking that i might have made a terrible mistake by proceeding with this move and pitting myself against a high-aptitude cohort filled with computing students from polytechnic who received automatic exemptions, and those who were successful in international competitions. but as you can see, i managed to be very precise with my code for the practical assessments, which pulled my grades up significantly above the cohort. it shows the extreme importance of getting your practicals done right for this course.the main reason i was initially struggling was because coming from python back in h 2 computing, i wasn't used to the strong & statically-typed nature of java, and dealing with the typing relationships shenanigans that it has. once the object-oriented programming part of the course comes to an end and we move on to the functional programming part, things became much more intuitive for me. with the benefit of hindsight, i'll say that to do well for the major assessments, it is important that you are clear of the dynamic binding process, type cast checks, the type inference process and stream processing.resultspractical assessment 1: 14/15 practical assessment 2: 24/25 midterm assessment: 36/60 (median: ≈

spirit of negative marking, i shall follow the same style in rating:up to -2 for quality of teaching (-0.1)up to -2 for difficulty (-1)up to -3 for workload (-1.5)up to -3 for enjoyability (-0.3)overall: 7.1/10 on to the actual review:would like to preface by saying dr. adi is one of the most dedicated and passionate lecturers i have encountered so far. he will definitely take the time to explain concepts to you and if you are interested to explore things further, definitely go for his office hours. his passion is honestly quite inspiring. on to the (rather long) review:many would advise to take this mod in sem 2 for an easier time and with good reason, the exams and pes are definitely harder, with pes having a 1 to 1 mapping to the % contributed to your grades. however, i would say that overall, the experience in sem 1 feels better.slides & lectures:firstly, the slides made by dr. adi is one of the best i have seen so far. he uses a in-browser slideshow with additional plugins that makes it much more interactive. the slides are also very well designed and informative, and he puts in the effort to animate certain concepts which helps a lot in illustration, especially when it came to the fork-join pool. this makes the slides very useful for revision, as compared to the minimal style in sem 2 though preferences may differ.dr. adi's lectures are also one of the more entertaining ones i've been to. he makes it engaging and often cracks jokes or have memes in his slides to make things less dry. there are also occasional (non graded) quizzes for you to test your understanding during the lecture. i would say that he explains the concepts quite well.as mentioned in another review, he would sometimes go slightly off tangent and talk about topics beyond the syllabus. i personally quite enjoyed it as i do think lectures are not meant to ensure you completely understand a topic immediately (after all there are very good online notes you should read). rather, learning something from lecturers' expertise makes going for lectures/studying in uni more meaningful. maybe it was just me but my interest in cs definitely deepened with the extra sharing.as a bonus, if you spot errors in his code, he would invite you to his office to get a rubber duck.notes:the online notes in sem 1 is almost the same as those in sem 2, with some extra explanation/ code examples added by dr. adi. if you want more details, definitely check out the sem 1 versions. there are some topics like type erasure that has quite significant additions in the sem 1 notes. these additions were definitely very helpful in making the topics easier to understand.assignments & assessments:the weekly lab exercises were also improved from those in 23/24 sem 2, as previously (after ex 4) each exercise was based on the previous week's. this meant that if you missed out on 1, catching up is much harder and could easily snowball to the end. this sem, the class files of the previous week's exercise were provided, which made it more manageable as your mistakes wouldn't snowball. he also cut out a number of tasks for certain exercises which made it much more manageable.i guess with better resources comes harder papers, as the midterms and finals in sem 1 are usually much tougher than those in sem 2. questions in sem 2 usually feel more robotic and as long as you understand what is going on, it should be quite doable. in sem 1, you would usually have to think further and it is not as straightforward. dr adi also likes to set themes in his midterm tests, with this year being themed after jujutsu kaisen and pe 1  themed after legends of zelda. i personally thought it made the paper more interesting to do though some may find that it makes things more confusing.my only gripe is that pe 1 and pe 2 are out of 15 and 25 respectively which corresponds to 15% and 25% of our grades. this means failing 1 test case/ making any style errors will cause a huge blow to your overall score, as compared to sem 2 where the pes were out of 40 and 45 respectively.the formats for pe 1 was also slightly different. in 23/24 sem 2, tasks were broken up into multiple parts which built upon each other. this sem, it was just 1 entire question (doing a simulation, similar to labs but simplified). they also introduced a take home element this ay which was aimed at making life easisr for us, where we had around 2 days to make non-design changes to our code. this definitely helps with reducing some cases of 0 marks due to compilation error, though if we made any ""illegal"" changes, the code we submitted at the end of the pe would be used for grading instead. regarding ""illegal"" changes, there was no clear rule as they did not want us to find loopholes. it was just mentioned that we should make non-design changes only.overall, i think not many will notice the slight (positive) changes dr. adi makes to the course in sem 1, and while passing/ doing well in sem 1 definitely feels much harder due to the difficulty of papers and pes i would say the experience is better too.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ssandyrock 36 months agoedited""maybe the key

tohttps://nus-cs 2030 s.github.io/2425-s 1/for the full list- there are 41 units in total, with units 0-27 tested for midterms/pe 1, 0-37 tested for pe 2, and 0-40 tested for finals- in essence, this course can be broadly split into two parts: object-oriented programming (oop) and functional programming (fp)assessment:- 5% self-diagnostic quizzes: unlimited attempts, 12 quizzes in total, best 10 quizzes counted- 5% programming exercises: 8 exercises in total, 1% per exercise, capped at 5%- 1% pe 0 (1 h): basically just a mock pe 1, only applicable if you don't get full marks for pe 1+pe 2- 15% pe 1 (1.5 h*): new format introduced this year, details below- 25% pe 2 (2 h)- 20% midterms (1 h)- 30% finals (2 h)- starting from 23/24 sem 2, all exams for cs 2030 s are cheatsheet-only.(*) new pe 1 format:- for this semester, we had a new format for pe 1, where were given approximately 48 hoursafter the exam to modify our code. however, we were only allowed to makenon-design changes- to prevent loopholes, prof adi did not give a formal set of guidelines, but in essence, we couldn't modify anything that was public, but could modify anything that was private- if design changes were detected, the changes would be discarded, and grading would be done on the original code archived at the end of pe 1 instead. to my knowledge, these rules wereenforced quite strictly, as i've heard a few friends getting their changes reverted- although i believe this new format was introduced to help prevent students from getting zero for pe 1 due to non-compilation of their code, prof explicitly said that adding missing semi-colons, closing parentheses, etc. would be considered design changes, and thus not allowed, so perhaps it'snot a good idea to rely on thisto make post-exam changesreview:- personally, i found prof adi quite a passionate lecturer, one can definitely sense his enthusiasm for programming languages. he's also very responsive to questions posted on edstem, often replying within 24 hours with detailed responses- however, during lectures, he tends to go into tangents. for example, when were were transitioning from oop to fp, he delved into category theory and class isomorphisms which i found difficult to follow- one nitpick i have with this module is that although the module does fulfill its objective of teaching oop and fp, at times it felt i was just learning how to be thehuman equivalent of a java compiler- many exam questions basically boil down to ""does this code compile?"" or ""what is the output?"", which can be very tricky at times (with alternate answers even being found by students and accepted by the prof after the exams)- despite scoring nearly full marks for both midterms and pe 1, i found itimpossibleto finish them both within the time limit. in contrast, pe 2 and finals were significantly easier to finish on time- another thing to note is that the paper formats are different between sem 1 and 2 (main difference is pe 1). for pe 1, in sem 1, you're expected to refactor poorly written code, whereas in sem 2, you're expected to build new code incrementally from scratch- while refactoring sounds easier, i personally found sem 2's format more straightforward, as there's less mental overhead since one can jump into implementing code directly. however, for refactoring, not only do you have to figure out what the optimal implementation is, but you also need time to analyze the messy code provided, and figure out how to modify/use it, as you can't simply delete all classes and start from scratch, because some classes must be retained and used- for sem 1, negative marking was also used, where everyone starts with 15/15, and marks are deducted for each ""mistake"". theoretically, it was possible to get -15/15 (penalty of -30), though i have to admit in the end prof adi marked extremely leniently for pe 1, as he didn't penalize many things he said he would've penalizedworkload:- as part of the cs trinity, this is a high workload mod. you're basically expected to learn the java programming language, linux terminal commands, and the vim editor within the first 3 weeks- even with prior programming experience, i don't think it'll help a ton, as there are a fair bit of new concepts taught. for instance, did you know that having getters and setters are bad? mindblowing stuff- supposedly, there was an attempt to reduce the workload for the weekly programming exercises, but at least for me, it didn't really feel like that was the case- that said, the workload felt like it got better after pe 1,

find it very useful given how i have used javascript promises (analagous to java's completablefuture which you would learn in this course) chaining in personal software projects.preparation wise, i did not prepare for labs as compared to recitations. tas would usually go though the pre-lab sheets during lab sessions. these problem sets are usually quite trivial. however, for recitations, problems sets often included past year exam questions. attempting them helps to reinforce conceptual understanding. i would usually spent an hour doing so.regarding workload, i would usually spend a full day on lab assignments and an hour on canvas quiz per week.overall, this course is very useful. even though software engineering is not the main aim of this course, it helps you to build up fundamentals necessary for building software projects. this course has high workload given the weekly tasking. lastly, i highly recommend attending recitations, as they go beyond lecture content and

wanted to say that it is totally possible to excel at cs 2030 s even if you didn't do very well in cs 1101 s (~65% for cs 1101 s vs 80.7% for cs 2030 s).in longer form, this is majorly what worked for me for this module:- don't skip lectures or skimp out on quizzes, and add on immediately to your cheatsheet with the week's topic instead of waiting till recess to do it. all these little things force you to read the very well-craftedlecture notesvery thoroughly and this is critical for exams- don't take the easy way out for recitations and labs (even if they feel out of hand) because these are the only practice you'll get apart from pyps for finals and especially practical assessments, which are all about speed and clarity. i still have no idea how i got 23/25 for pe 2 but i attribute it to going through all my labs, recitations and pyps with a microscope and taking note of everything i found interesting- if you're taking cs 2030 s in y 1 s 1, this is probably a mod you're doing after months (if you did cs 1010 x) or years (if you're simply exempted from cs 1101 s) of no school and thus may have gotten out of touch with exams. i fumbled my midterms somewhat (~10 m below median) because i mismanaged my time, didn't read the questions properly, and committed other blunders. from then on i vowed to at least attempt the whole paper (with even enough time to comb through it again from the start to root out careless mistakes) and i genuinely believe this boosted my marks by a loti'll end my review here but in short, just do the work consistently and cs 2030 s will reward you. i also did genuinely enjoy the content (especially the back half, which remains controversial among most people) and found it to be a very interesting and intuitive take on functional programming after

the other module coordinator (wei tsang) handles admin and teaches recitations well, and the content is well-structured, not too much, and exams are not too difficult.the learning curve is steep at the start, and i usually spend about 3 hours a week digesting the lecture notes. it is difficult, but once you make sure you really truly understand it, exams are a breeze. the recitation worksheets are also a reflection of class material while having some extension topics, and are definitely not too long for a 45 min recitation class. in this regard, i think the content is not overwhelming (unlike 2040 s) and is manageable but challenging. there is a ""fixed"" amount of things to learn in the sense that the concepts are well-structured and the questions that are set can't be too difficult as long as you've mastered those concepts.labs take about a day for me to do, so i guess the workload is pretty high despite what i've mentioned in the previous paragraph. but it is really good practice and to me i rather do lab assignments than have more lectures and content to digest.class time: 2 hour lecture, 1 hour recitation and 2 hour (usually ends in an hour) lab. really friendly for a core cs mod comparatively.overall this is a very very important module to learn right as oop is essentially the core of your day to day work as a software engineer in the future, and java is basically a ""core"" language too. it's also important to take this before or at the same time as 2040 s so you don't struggle with the java coding in 2040 s (which is barely touched

those concepts in real code. the labs and pes are quite challenging. they are mostly not straight forward and you'd need to practice and take time to think about it.in terms of content delivery, if i remember correctly, boyd delivered most of the contenti think the notes are very very good. i hardly watch lectures because i think boyd isnt as good in explaining as compared to the notes... but to each their own i guess. i think the notes are very very good. with that being said, ooi wei tsang is quite good and succinct with his explanation as i was in his recitation class.workload: 9/10 the only real 'compulsory' work are the weekly labs. however, they normally take up alot of time. usually takes me about 4 hours (cumulative) to complete them. but i think thats because i sit and do for 4 hours straight and it works for me. it might be shorter for yall who are smarter and longer for those who cant see the big picture quick.experience: 8/10 i think i took away alot from this mod. aside from the practical exam saga, which i dont think was that big of an issue anyways, it was carried out pretty well. the mod in general is very useful and taught in a systematic way such that its beginner-friendly and challenging at the same time. took this at the same time as cs 2040 s and this mod forced me to polish my java and it helped me for the weekly practical assignments for cs 2040

CS2040S,"This course introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The course covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, and basic analysis of algorithms."," −+mario lorenzo 5 years agotaken in ay 19/20 sem 1 lecturer: asst prof. harold sohgrading scheme: 5 problem sets (30%), 3 quizzes (20%, pick the highest two scores, 10% each), class participation (10%), final (40%)this is the first time cs 2040 s, as a new version of cs 2040 equivalent, is being offered. cs 2040 s is actually meant for cs students, but as long as there is a slot, you can still bid for one even though you are not a cs student, thus i ended up here :). unlike the other version of cs 2040, cs 2040 s requires one additional prerequisite, which is cs 1231/ma 1100 since students here are expected to be able to do some simple proofs that are being taught. therefore, expect (a lot) faster pace compared to cs 2040 and cs 2040 c. we finished the content of regular cs 2040 by week 11 and did some special non-examinable topics afterwards. some people may also read my cs 1231 module review and wondering why i am able to take cs 1231 and cs 2040 s concurrently. i filed an appeal to the department since i urgently need cs 2040 equivalent this semester to unlock the higher level modules, and the other cs 2040 equivalents clash with my other mods.this module covers basic data structures such as linked lists, heaps, bsts, hash tables and some sorting as well as graph algorithms. the contents are actually pretty shocking and heavy enough to make cs freshmen suffer. brace yourself for mind-twisting problems if you are not getting used to algorithmic problem solving.kudos to prof harold since he is able to make the class entertaining, thus making the module seems slightly easier, and i would like to say that he is one of the best professor in soc for me :). he is also very caring for the students and his explanations are very clear, making the heavy contents more digestible. his tas are also capable, know the contents very well and very responsive when i ask some questions.the five problem sets are released fortnightly and you have 2 weeks to complete each of them. kattis is used as a platform to do the problem sets. the number of compulsory problems from each problem sets range from 3-5 per sets. however, there are many optional problems for practices. the optional problems are crazy and it takes a lot of time to finish, so if you still care about your sanity, please don't attempt it lol since they may use other concepts outside cs 2040 s scopes and you may ended up reading research papers. the 3 quizzes test us on the understanding of the concepts by devising the most ""efficient"" algorithms to tackle some problems. the final is the nightmare among them. it is a 44 mcqs paper but actually the style of the question is similar to the quizzes, but the format is modified as mcqs. it is very annoying in my opinion since the problem is mostly like ""what is the most efficient algorithms that you can think of to solve blablabla?"" and there are some big-oh listed as the choices.study hard and lot of effort must be put in to get a fairly decent grade.expected grade: a/a+actual grade: a+see more 50 replyshare ›−+jjasting 98 mario lorenzo 5 years agoi tried to appeal just like you to be able to enter cs 2040 s while doing cs 1231

analysis is correct, you don't get any mark that qn too if the algo part isn't correct)(apparently, they said if ur algo is not absolutely correct then it's hard to tell ""how correct"" is it, thus no partial score is given), and if ur algo is absolutely correct but they think ur explanation isnt clear enuf, they'll give you ~60% of the score for the part) (and the biggest joke is them saying they're alr generous in terms of grading, ha)this makes it rly hard to distinguish within a large majority of student(despite the confirmed a+ and f ppl), like some ppl i k who r fr geniuses and got

for the most part alright especially given my prior experience, but the concepts are genuinely deceiving. you'd think you understand it, but then you attempt a past year's paper and have no idea what's going on. for my intake, they didn't really test any algorithm skills in the sense of actually writing a program. i guess because cohort size was large, both midterms and finals were entirely mcq, which means the concepts tested are mostly theory which i'm quite bad at, as it turns out.i was median for midterms, which was around 71/100. for finals they haven't released statistics yet, but i checked with the answer key and i'm quite sure i bombed it lol. oh well, guess i'll try harder next semester. as for how to study for this module, probably don't use my advice because i studied really hard and understood the concepts very well, but i'm afraid the results may not reflect that, which means there was probably something wrong with the way i attempted the questions / the way i

in my opinion if cs 2040 s is completely fine for you.workload: very high* - 11 hours / weeki watched every single lecture video (2 + 1 hours), attended every single tutorial class (2 hours). i did every single optional practice, attempted every contest and did every problem set diligently. i prepared for every tutorial class, and prepared for every recitation and some point. this summed up to be an average of about 10 hours per week. in retrospect, i wouldn't have spent this much time. there is no need to prepare for recitations, and tutorials can kind of be skimmed through and ""as long as you get the idea, it's fine"".  this can be way lower if you skip the (time-consuming) optional practices as well. perhaps, if i could redo this course, the workload would look more like ~6.5 hours

very clearly with many concrete examples, though his problem sets and exam papers can be very challenging.the tutorials are hybrid sessions of theory and practical. the tutors will make use of the problem sets to reinforce and extend the various concepts taught in lectures, after which there will be a hands-on session during which the students are tasked with a selected programming problem to practise the relevant concepts. prof halim dislikes asking his students to re-invent the wheels, so the main focus of the practical components in this course is to analyse the problems correctly and choose the best design using the ideal data structures, rather than to remember how each data structure or algorithm is implemented.overall, the course is very well structured and paced. recommended

−+infiinight 3 years agoay 21/22 sem 2, prof seth gilbert.i did this with the rest of the trinity this sem. if i had to compare with cs 2030 s and cs 2100, i'd say that content wise, cs 2100 has the most content, followed by cs 2030 s and then cs 2040 s. if we're talking about workload, then cs 2030 s would be highest, followed by cs 2100, and then cs 2040 s. difficulty wise will vary, but generally people seem to find cs 2040 s harder than cs 2030 s, with cs 2100 being relatively easy compared to these 2 modules. so looking at it this way, i would say that this mod is not very high workload, and content wise only covers basic concepts in the various topics.i was kind of disappointed by the lack of proofs and rigor in the various algorithms, considering they were expecting us to know how to reason about certain facts about the algorithms while not being rigorous at the same time. i personally think this creates a weak foundation, but for an intro mod, i suppose they're trying to fit as much breadth as possible. nonetheless, prof seth is a great lecturer. i highly recommend taking it under him.i would rate this module as being medium difficulty, with low workload. i can see why people would say this module is high workload, especially if you try to finish all your tutorial questions. i tend to give them a try and just leave it if i can't solve them after awhile, and it worked out for me. this approach made the mod experience much more enjoyable and enriching for me, since i'm just focused on learning rather than clearing the work.if you have to choose 2 out of 3 in

−+xxh 3 years agoay 21/22 sem 2, prof seth gilbertthis is the module with the highest workload i have ever seen. it's really way beyond my expectations. for starters, there are 2 lectures a week (2 hour and 1 hour). content is hard but prof explains it well and in an engaging manner (polls during lectures are fun).the real workload comes from tutorial and recitation questions. tutorial questions are super hard; you spend a long time trying to solve it before tutorial, and if you get a sucky ta, you spend an even longer time trying to digest it after tutorials. recitations introduce whole new data structures sometimes, and for a 1 hour lesson, the number of questions and concepts is frankly insane. my ta is always rushing through and can never quite finish. needless to say, i spend another huge amount of time digesting it after recitations. now for problem sets. there are easier ones and extremely hard ones that i spend sometimes 2 days doing (because i do them on my own with basically no help; but you can always ask your friends for the strategy). i spent basically the whole reading week just to review the tutorial and recitation questions.the biggest problem i had from this module is that you can learn the concepts well and do practice and go through every single tutorial and recitation question, but still be stumped by the exam. it's because there are always questions that require you to be big brain and think out of the box, almost like you need creativity in a sense. it's not just a matter of applying concepts you have learned. and as such, the amount of work you do doesn't always correlate with your grade since those tricky questions you see in your practice will never come out again. yet, it is important to go through the incredibly heavy amount of work and overwhelming content properly because exposure to such questions early will help you with revision for interviews.that being said, i am glad that cs 2040 s is such an incredibly challenging module because it is really important for interviews, and having a good foundation and materials will help you in preparing for interviews in the future. it was pain and suffering to go through it, but just

experience in informatics olympiad, so the content was easy to pick up and the module wasn’t very challenging.problem sets are doable in a few hours, though i’m not sure what’s the reason for gatekeeping private testcases as these just caused a lot of pain and didn’t really help with learning. it is very common for the forums to be flooded with people looking for help with private testcases since there are only a few public testcases given and no information is given upon failure.i feel that some of the questions in tutorials / problem sets / recitations are a little convoluted and hard to read; i remember reading a one page question and not being able to understand the problem for like half an hour. problem sets tend to beat around the bush a bit too much for my liking. don’t really have much to complain about content-wise i guess.tutorials are problem based, where students discuss and share solutions before the ta goes through the suggested solutions. if you didn’t look at the tutorial sheet beforehand you probably would be pretty lost.if you asked me i would say recitation is kind of “bonus content”, they aren’t very necessary but act as understanding checks

to debug with no information. i hope future iterations do away with this as it just slows down learning and causes stress. lecture reviews are mcq / mrq, pretty short and can be finished in 10 minutes.midtermsfinalshistorically these were notorious for their extremely large mcq weightage (often up to 100%), but this semester they introduced quite a bit of psuedocode writing, which i think is good to test student’s understanding. midterms had 1 huge avl tree augmentation question, while finals had a mix of dp and graph problems. being able to express your solution clearly is important, i was pretty sure i knew how to solve the problems but ended up rewriting my solution multiple times and it still ended up incorrect because i misread / confused myself. for finals i screwed up quite badly, got like 0 for 2 whole questions, but after appeal managed to get +11 marks. i think there were quite a lot of complaints about the grading, if you think you deserve more marks its worth a shot. heavy dose of copium but i would have preferred a practical exam to test application as having testcases would help with weeding out stupid errors from misreading and off by 1 s but oh

drain. i was a victim of this, losing 9 out of 10 marks in finals in dynamic programming bcoz i didnt explicitly state dynamic programming or use a table, i thought it was implied. ig i'll just have to take that -9 marks l.marking is definitely hell for them since its open ended, i get the sense that some markers can't be bothered coz they just reply with one liners ""if you run your code, you will see that it is wrong"". mine didn't even give a proper counter example and i had to appeal like twice. the appealing process was also hell it was like defending ur answer in court or sth, feels q

programming (incl. floyd-warshall's)lectureofficially, i was allocated the l 1 lecture slot, taught by professor diptarka chakraborty. i quickly realised that the l 2 lecturer, professor eldon chung, who was the one heading this course this semester, taught much better and clearer, and mainly attended his lectures for the semester. he starts off every class with ""are you ready to learn some algorithms?"", regularly pre-empt himself, and teaches very clearly. if i am not wrong, this is his first time heading this course, and i think he has done a great job.recitationmr eldric liew chun tze was my recitation teacher and he does a good job at teaching, though thanks to the sheer amount of content and hundreds of slides that have to be gone through in one hour he sometimes have to skip through a lot of stuff, and you probably have to go back and reread some of the stuff. i also attended 1 recitation with mr muhammad rizki aulia rahman maulana and mr ben leong, and they are good tutors as well, with the former preferring to use the whiteboard, and the latter doing a better job at keeping to the time limit. generally the teaching staff in cs 2040 s are pretty strong and you are in good hands if you take this course.tutorialadmittedly, i often find myself lost when entering or leaving a tutorial session, where you have some theoretical examples where you apply data structures & algorithms to solve problems. similarly i have to go back and reread to understand some of the stuff, and how i can apply what i learnt in lecture for the scenarios.assessmentcoursemology: ??%midterms: ??%finals: ??%the weightage of the assessments are unknown, which according to eldon, is ""to avoid people min-maxxing their grades for cs 2040 s or making strategic moves instead of learning as much as they can in this module"".for coursemology, there are about 24 lecture reviews to be completed at the end of each lecture, with a pretty tight bonus deadline of as little as 1 day after the lecture ends. since the review is opened sometime after the last lecture slot finishes their class, i recommend that you set a regular reminder to avoid missing out on these lecture reviews. there are also 8 problem sets which are usually due 7 days from their opening. a few optional practices are also available. to get full marks for the coursemology component, your target is to hit level 35 of coursemology. a maximum of level 40 can be attained if you do all mandatory and optional components diligently, which will immortalise yourself in the leaderboard for bragging rights.the 105 minutes, 60 marks midterms cover content up till trees, consisting of 6 questions. the first 2 questions are routine ones about interpreting time complexity and recurrence relations, the next 3 about theoretical sorting, and the last one is a 22 mark question about designing a data structure that could be applied a certain context.the 120 minutes, 70 marks finals focuses on graphs, and consists of 6 questions. the first 2 questions consist of a total of 20 marks of mcqs and short answer questions as is typical in the past. but the next 4 questions involve applying data structures & algorithms, and some heuristics and augmentations taught in the recitation, like super nodes and making graph copies to represent multiple states, to solve novel problems.this makes the midterms and finals questions very different from past semesters, there's less algorithmic analysis of time complexity and invariants, and more practical application of what you have learnt. this is actually much more important for a level-2000 course. however, if you cannot figure out the way to solve a problem correctly and efficiently, you are cooked, so i expect that the grade distribution will be lower this year.conclusionthis is a foundational course mass produced to educate almost a thousand computer science students every year, and i am impressed how well-run it is. it is worth noting that this course is more theoretical than practical. other than the problem sets, we do not actually have to implement anything that we learnt in java. if you can give rough descriptions when applying a solution to a problem, that is good enough. do not be too specific, you will lose marks.speaking as a former h 2 computing student, i found many familiar topics in this course, such as sorting, searching, time complexity, binary search trees, and hashing. i believe this put me at a slight advantage in this course than the typical cs student. however the ideas in h 2 computing are further expanded into in this course, so while it gives you a slight advantage, you still need to put in effort here, especially for the graph topics which were not previously covered.resultscoursemology: 39/35 midterms: 48/60 finals: 41/70 see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ssocacademicvictima month agoay 24/25 sem 2 prof: eldon the goatreci tutor: ben leong

about lectures since i didn't attend any. reviewer is somewhat experienced coder, but a far cry from programming competitively :/tl;dr new prof, new style (i call it ""armchair leetcoding""),prepare yourself by solving coding problems frequently. intellectually challenging module, currently quite rough around the edges. looks like it's going to get cooked into something good the next few years.things you learn:all concepts are taught at averyhigh level (that is, beyond any programming language, hence ""armchair leetcoding""). this doesn't make it any easier, because you are expected

(although, you do use them to write your coursemo problem set solutions, in... j... java....)- how toroughlyanalyze data structures and algorithms (asymptotic time/space complexity, invariants, basics of amortised analysis, expected-time analysis, recursive algorithms)- binary search techniques- sorting algorithms (studied in detail: bubblesort, insertionsort, selectionsort, mergesort, quicksort)- tree data structures (n-ary tree, binary search tree, avl tree (representing balanced bsts), tries, etc.)- hash tables (open addressing, chaining, some funky hash methods)- array-based heaps- graphs (bfs, dfs, dijkstra, bellman-ford, minimum spanning trees with prim's, kruskal's)- how to model problems as graph problems.- union-find disjoint set (quick find, quick union, union-by-weight, path compression)- dynamic programming (lis, vertex cover on a tree, bounded prize collection, all pairs shortest paths, 0-1 knapsack)subjective review:workload: 5/10 (frequent, but manageable. you have one problem set, one tutorial, one recitation per week.)enjoyability: 7/10 (had a good ta, and solved some interesting problems. )difficulty: 7.5/10 (mostly from the ""armchair leetcoding"", which i am 1000% not the best at, and am somewhat unfairly derisive of. basic concepts are piss easy, but translating your foundations into actual, ""get it right the first try"" problemsolving isreallyrough.)comments:have mixed feelings about this module, probably because it got a new prof, and i guess people will have to wait and see where he takes it.so far the emphasis has changed from know thy algos to ""ok show me you understand by solving x problem"".obviously it's really useful and cool to think about interesting problems, so that's the biggest plus point about this change.iffyou apply yourself, you can really learn a lot about architecting high-level solutions to programming challenges (invariant analysis was the coolest to me).(for the more mercenary amongus, this also helps in technical interviews...)unfortunately the lessons from this module mesh poorly with how i code (which, could be more of an indictment of how i code, honestly), which is heavily reliant on a rapid ""write-and-debug"" cycle. so i didn't become as proficient as i probably could have been.would be nice if, as part of the problem-solving value proposition of this module, the course somehow helps it become easier to come up with solutions just by thinking alone. but until then one can only dream, and play more leetcode/project euler/whatever you can think of to get the necessary intuition...assessment components:unlike most other courses so far, grade breakdown is completely unknown.1. coursemology xp (level 35 or ~28 k xp => full marks. whatever ""full"" is.)2.

at 2 x and i couldn't understand what was going on. so i decided to just read the slides later on. most of what i learned came from the tutorials, so thank you jasion ciu.i didn't like the problem sets, they were very ... tedious. i spent so much more time debugging than thinking, but i at least i learned to implement from there.and then, for the mid terms, i wasn't able to fully finish the last problem, which comprised 19/62 of the total points, so i just wrote a very inefficient o(n) solution instead of the actual o(log n) solution for the whole problem. by the mercy of eldon chung, i was rewarded 8+ marks in that problem. bear in mind that this is the make up so it has a slightly different marking scheme.as i finish my finals, i realise that i came up with a whopping o(n^4) solution for one of the problems, which apparently, was nowhere near as efficient as the o(n^2 log n) solution i learned after the exam which uses ufds. i actually wanted to write that during the exam, but i was wary of the complexity. in other words, i didn't fully ""understand"" the algorithm, or else i would have just written that. to be fair, i wasn't confident about ufds, so this is an acceptable defeat. additionally, i forgot to write the base case for the dynamic programming problem at the end.so once again i hope i am spared the mercy of eldon chung or whoever holds my finals

solving problems, but not the explicit code. recitations are harder versions of tutorials, sometimes introducing new content. note that everything can be tested (especially b-trees, which is exclusively covered in recitations).pseudocode is overused in this course imo. for those who prefer a more hands-on approach to learning, you may want to check out the semester 1 iteration, which has

spanning treesdynamic programmingthoughts on content and lectures:the first half of the content was taught by prof seth, and he is a good teacher albeit goes quite fast. he explains ideas well and is enthusiastic, and attending his lectures was enjoyable. the second half was taught by prof arnab, who just wasn’t good at explaining ideas and would often have me confused when he tried to derive or prove something. i resorted to watching past year recorded lectures instead, where the whole sem was taught by prof seth. i felt that the first half of the content, up to trees, was reasonably easy to understand, and i suppose that was reflected in the midterms. hashing was where the content started getting difficult (especially with how it was tested in finals), and graphs and graph searching algorithms were also not particularly easy to prove although it wasn’t difficult to obtain a high-level understanding (that was later more solidified by doing the problem sets). dynamic programming seemed a bit rushed, although if one has prior knowledge on the topic then it wasn’t too difficult.assessments (breakdown not provided)coursemology:a few components go into this grade. for full credit, you have to reach level 35 (30000 xp) by the end of the course (week 13 friday). most people do.problem sets: these are programming tasks. you don’t need a particularly great understanding of java to do this, or even how the ide works. the ide already does help you a lot, as do the test files and the ide itself, so details about how java works and the syntax are a non-issue. the difficulty is more of designing algorithms that work and provide results in reasonable time-complexities, but even that, isn’t particularly difficult the way some labs in cs 2030 s are. most problem sets are 1000-3000 xp (if you get full marks) and the deadline is typically 6-7 days after they’re released. they do allow you to get a good grasp of how an algorithm works, and how to implement it, though, so they are helpful for learning. expect to take anywhere from 2 to 10 h on a problem set, depending on which one you’re doing and how much debugging you have to do. the problem sets being on coursemology does mean there are both public and private test cases, and one thing that myself and peers did get stuck on at times was figuring out why our solution was not passing private test cases, though that was typically to do with edge cases, but my ta in particular was helpful with debugging and suggestions to pass private cases.there are also lecture reviews (mcq quizzes on lecture content) that have to be done within 24 h of the lecture for the full marks (250 xp each) and are not too difficult.tutorial attendance & participation also count towards the coursemology grade, with about 400-600 xp per session, the exact amount awarded depends on ta. not a lot to say, my ta gave those who did tutorial questions beforehand and shared their answers more than those who did not. tutorial questions are hard and certainly interesting, but there were multiple times where i simply had no idea where to start. sometimes though, they could be better set, as evidenced when the answer sheet had to void the question.archipelago quizzes were also worth 50 xp per session, for participating during the lectures.there was also extra credit for optional practices and optional questions in problem sets, but they’re worth much less than getting all questions in problem sets right, so that should be the focus.midterms:as mentioned in another review, they were quite easy, with a lot of people scoring well over 80/100. the average was probably also slightly higher than past years. format was also similar to past years, except that an ambiguous sorting question ended up requiring multiple combinations of answers to be accepted. additionally, the last question did seem a bit ridiculous with >20 mcq options, but the weightage wasn’t too large.finals:this was quite difficult. already in the past year papers, it was notable that 2023’s paper was more difficult than years before, and this year’s was even more difficult than previous years. i expected to get <50/100 for finals after walking out, and most of my peers felt the same too. there was 19 marks of ‘trivia’ which was a little annoying, but by far what most disliked was that there were 22 marks of ‘stats’ questions, which were to do with expectation and probability in hashing, involving some derivation/proof and knowledge of permutations and combinations. i personally found it somewhat doable, but not quite what was taught (well). that being said, throughout most of the paper, i felt that i was making a lot of guesses that i didn’t have confidence in, and so did most of my peers. later questions on graph search algorithms and dynamic programming were also heavy, with walls of text and notation to choose between, making it difficult to do the paper quickly (and time was a concern).recitations:the introductory lecture said that attendance would be graded but i did not see my tutor taking attendance, neither did i see xp awarded on coursemology. that being said, eldric is amazing at teaching (you know it when people are willing to sit on the floor to attend his class) and explaining big ideas, and is certainly very enthusiastic. and unsurprisingly, ideas of how to approach recitation questions were tested in finals, so attending them is useful (and the problems i personally found very interesting).overall thoughts:this is an important and useful module. programming skill isn’t really tested, neither is speed/accuracy of creating algorithms, instead focusing heavily on efficiency of the algorithms and proof that they work. i suppose there could be more rigour on the practical aspects of implementing algorithms and even data structures (such as sorting algorithms, graph search, or heaps/priority queues, or even hash functions), but already the content and time spent on understanding was somewhat heavy.expected grade: b+see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ddong zhu! buxu zou!a year agotaken in ay 22/23 semester 2 lecturers: prof seth gilbert, prof

optional practices)midterm:extremely easy which caused finals to be crazy. everything until hashing is tested (hashing not included).finals:extremely difficult a lot of probability and statistic questions were tested close to 30%. way difficult compared to the pyps but it is wat it is. some chapters were not tested at all such as msts and union find which were surprising as that was 20% of the mod not being tested.workload:normal cs workload i would say. definitely lower than cs 2030 s and cs 2100. the content is very surface level, one can get away with just knowing how the data structure and algo works and it would be enough to get a good grade for the mod. people who took cs 1010 x have a decent advantage when it comes to workload as there are many overlaps between cs 2040 s such as hashing, dynamic programming, time complexity, union find, sorting to name a few. although cs 1010 x is less in depth it really eases the workload as its more of building on concepts one already knows. most of the workload comes from the ps but the issue is that the ps is literally on github so iykyk.thoughts:1. a good mod every cs student needs.2. it is extremely beneficial to take cs 2040 s with st 2334 due to increasing trend of probability questions being tested, i am not surprised if the next finals have >40% of the questions being stats related.3. if you took cs 1010 x beforehand the workload for this mod dramatically decreases so you may want to take more mods or another cs mod such as cs 2102/ cs 2105.4. one room for improvement is definitely coursemology, to say that its bad is an understatement. for example being able to know why the code fails is something so simple to implement i am surprised its still not. also being able to compared your output to coursemology's output is also something that is not hard to do so i wonder why it's not available.5. lastly would be the heavy use of pseudocode. i am not kidding when i say that one is able to get a good grade without being able to code in java. for example, how many students can actually implement quicksort after taking cs 2040 s, probably less than 50. how many students can implement weighted union find or implement dijkstra algorithm probably even lesser. i understand that cs is theoretical but still it is indeed quite concerning for students to get an a for this mod without even knowing how to code. perhaps a pe or something makes more sense.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ccentes 2 years agotaken in ay 2324 s 1 under prof steven halimworkload:- 6 + 1 problem sets

excessive usage of pseudocode (oftentimes with errors) in the lecture slides. i think it would have been much more helpful to link to the actual implementation of different algorithms. there were some hiccups with the uploading of lecture recordings after recess week. as a result, i stopped watching the lecture recordings and mainly relied on the lecture slides, textbook, and tutorials to keep up with the course content.if you do want to watch lectures, you can view past year recordings on youtube, or check outabdul bari'schannel.tutorialshalfway through the semester, i gave up on trying to finish the tutorials as they were too difficult for me and i did not have enough time to work on them. the approach i would recommend is to spend maybe half an hour before the lesson skimming through the tutorial questions to get an idea of what will be discussed in class, and paying attention when your ta is going through the questions.i found the tutorials to be extremely helpful in demystifying the concepts in the lecture notes (probably because i had a very good ta). my tutorial sessions almost always took up the entire 2-hour slot, so schedule your lessons accordingly.recitationssimilar to tutorials, you should aim to briefly read through the recitation questions beforehand. i don't think you are meant to be able to solve most of the questions. take note that the recitation topics (such as a,b-trees) can be tested in exams, so do include those in your cheatsheet.overalli've heard from some seniors that the format of this module is quite different between semester 1 and 2. for cs students, i would highly recommend that you take this mod in y 1 s 2, given the importance of data structures and algorithms for coding interviews.this is a tough module, and some resources which i

fundamental data structures and algorithms. the module covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, and basic analysis of algorithms.difficulty rating: 6/10 enjoyment rating: 7/10 this was an exciting module that covers a little of everything - mathematics and statistics, algorithm design, data structures, java and object oriented programming. certainly it would be one of the most practically useful classes since algorithms questions are indeed very common in interviews.some mathematics may be taught in this class, especially in the part about hash tables where quite simple statistics is used in a short proof on time complexities. whatever is learnt in cs 1231 s, perhaps except graph searching, may not necessarily be prerequisite knowledge in this course.algorithm design might play second fiddle to theory in this class, which was the focus of the midterms and the finals. much of the course was on time complexities and algorithm analysis, considering the professor's background, for example pivot selection for quicksort, or cuts for graphs. thankfully, prof gilbert made the derivations simple to understand and quite intuitive.programming assignments, i.e. implementing algorithms were done on coursemology in the form of problem sets. these were not too trivial, as the average student may have only touched java as the course started. it also required a good understanding of the theory at first, as coding without having a plan is often not a good idea. instead of toy problems seen perhaps in a number of other classes, the problem sets were part of a larger useful application, such as decoding images or word autocomplete - you had to implement the key procedures to make the application work. certainly they won't be what you would do on leetcode, but it makes learning a fair bit more exciting. there were a number of optional problem sets, but i was too lazy to do them. somehow, there were no problem sets or examinations questions on dynamic programming, however important it may be.quizzes, called lecture trainings, also happened after lectures, and together with problem sets, they contributed to the coursemology grade. to get full marks for this ca component, one would need to hit level 35, but the difficult problem sets meant that it was out of reach to me.tutorials were two hours each week and focused on difficult word problems. since algorithms are not the easiest things to learn, quite a number of people in my tutorial group were quite confused even about the most basic concepts. i heard that even some tas were unable to explain the hardest questions. recitations were even harder than that, and talked about interesting theoretical problems as well - for my session there was basically one person who dominated the entire discussion. i could have learnt a lot more if i had the patience and mental tenacity to really understand what was going on.examinations were two hours each and focused mostly on algorithm correctness and efficiency. about 15 out of 100 marks were dedicated to a slightly tricky design question, similar to the problem sets. you really have to know the tiny details of the algorithms to get the harder questions correct. thankfully, i got around the median score for these two, so it goes to show that the tutorials are way too difficult for the average student.ultimately, this was a very well-designed class, and i really did take home a lot about algorithms though having put a lot less effort into learning than my peers. it was unfortunate that due to my coursemology grade, i incurred a b, which was a little disappointing given that the module did not seem to be bell curved. if it is possible, take this module in semester 2 since seth gilbert will be making algorithms intuitive, and try to learn about applications of algorithms as they guide you. in semester 1, it seems that you may get to do a lot more leetcode style problems.[see my other module reviews athttps://spergiemcsperglord....]see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+beginnercoder 3 years agotaken in ay 21/22 sem 2

(midterm review)so far this semester's iteration of the mod has been an administrative disaster. i may update this review if things get better in the second half, but right now i just want to put this dreadful experience behind me asap.so far, there has been announcements, every week, because almost every piece of coursework has had some error in one place or another. it has reached the point (at least, for me) where i find it nearly impossible to do any of the assignments, because i cannot trust anything i see...if i have any tips for future students, do not rely on lectures, just take a quick glance at the material for each week and bury yourself in past-year papers. the labs and tutorials so far have been very unhelpful for actually solving questions in assignments/exams (in fact you are liable to walk away with all sorts of misconceptions about how things work).see more 40 replyshare ›show more replies −+ddong zhu! buxu zou!a year agoeditedtaken in ay 23/24 sem 1 instructor: colin tan, prabhu natarjan, aaron tan tuck choy, wong weng faitldr:good teaching n content. terrible admin, terrible communication, good teaching cant make up for lack of respect of the profs.contents:1. c programming, computer number systems 2. mips, control path, isa architectures 3. boolean algebra & k-maps 4. msi components (decoder, encoder, multi/demultiplexers), combinational circuits, sequential circuits 5. pipelining and cachingassessments:10% lab:prof blatantly copies from past years. i don't have much respect for the labs as no effort is being done to update the labs. just ask your seniors for the answers n get the easiest 10% of your life.5% tutorial participationfree. tutorial depends on ur ta. my ta was enzio a fulltime ta. he comes off kinda arrogant but is not bad ig. maybe he's too smart for me.4% x 3 homeworksjust collaborate with your friends. if you don't prepare to get screwed over by the curve as median is close to full marks.3% online quizzeseasy u can just go to the unoffical 2100 tele to get the answers. some fella always make a new one.20% midterm 50% finalworkloadwise, this module has light to moderate workload. not much to memorise too. labs are a joke, tutorial is a joke too one tutorial was to create a powerpoint which is ridiculous as that chapter was tested q heavily for exams. the tutorials were like drawing a stickman while the test exam asking u to draw the mona lisa, ridiculous.lectures: lectures are uploaded on friday night and the students are expected to watch the lectures and complete the online quiz every week. lectures sometimes are only 1 hour but sometimes, the lecture is 3+ hours long, so it really depends on what the contents are for that particular week. lecture contents were clearly presented for all 4 profs who recorded the video. good content but the 4 buffoons decide to not test any of it in the exams.exams: exam is a clownfest with clowns organising. firstly it is actually impossible to finish the exam in the allocated time. furthermore is on examplify. imagine typing 32 digits and if u are off by 1 digit u get the whole qn wrong. now imagine doing that 10-20 times in the exam. now imagine that you want to trace the circuit, but guess what, the exam is on examplify so just take your thumb and suck on it cuz ur screwed. now imagine spending the whole exam converting numbers and letters to binary, you would think that a top 8 university exam would test the content involved and not tedious and meticulous conversion that a monkey could do, well you guessed wrong. basically the profs made sure the student's life and exam was needlessly hard as possible. maybe cuz they were angry no one showed up during recitation but is it really fair to punish us this way? now imagine u got 15/17 qns correct surely u would pass the exam right?? well get screwed as the last 2 qns are worth half the paper cuz prof didn't allocate the marks. this certainly seems vv fair. in fact when one student emailed a prof lets call him ct, ct said in real life with real projects one should always be prepared n sometimes deliverable are unknown thus the mark allocation shouldn't be given so students attempt every qn. that is such a clown statement. in real life do u think i would need to convert hexadecimal to binary by hand??? would i use kmaps to solve stuff when i can use a calculator??? that is simply ridiculous. in the end ct did release the allocation but the fact that he contemplated not releasing it is ridiculous. furthermore for midterms according to the prof open book policy means 1 page cheat sheet oni as its nus policy but miraculously for finals thats open book we are able to use the pdfs and word documents on our laptop, how surprising indeed.overall: overall computer organisation is indeed an important course for any cs student. it truly is a shame that its not the content that stuck but rather the profs' lack of respect to the students that really made me remember this mod. i mean i guess it really enforces the cs stereotype that cs pple are disrespectful and have no eq. i am from cs and i don't think i will ever take another cs mod with these profs as the module coordinator. i'd rather eat sand then take their mods.edit: one more thing to add is that miraculously the pyp answers were very limited as ""there is no official ans key"". but miraculously many answer keys pop up when there is supposedly no such answer key. it makes me wonder why the profs blatantly gatekeep the answers, i guess learning is not a top priority then. this resulted in people actively gatekeeping past year paper answers which is quite cs of them to say the least. but overall this just increases the toxicity of the course for no proper reason.see more 30

the content really dry)suffering: 10/10 (i just can't do these lower level circuits stuff..dont have enough brain cells for that..or cs in general lmao)grades: a big fat d+ (thank god i passed)here are my score breakdownsassignments: close to full marks (17-19/20 range),labs: close to full marks for all my labs (off by 1-2 marks on ave)tutorial attendance: full marksmidterm: 11/40 (idk my percentile)finals: 18/100 (around 5 percentile) hahhaoverall sentiments:it was a really hard mod for me, i guess mainly because the content is quite heavy with 2 x lectures a week, tutorials, labs, assignments, mid terms and final exams. i was taking this along with 2030 and actually found 2030 more manageable because content wise, 2030 is lesser i feel. here is a website for the course in case anyone wants to read up beforehand :https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg...lecturersi had prof adi before midterm and prof aaron tan for after midterm. they are both super nice and dedicated lecturers. lectures are 2 x a week though, i usually watch at 1.5 x speedcontenti found the content quite dry. some topics we learnt includes number systems, mips, instruction set architecture, sequential & combination circuits, pipelining, caching. there are some stuff like combinational circuits, which i cannot for my life, learn how to do quickly within time constraints (in the words of prof aaron, 'can see means can see, cannot see means cannot see'...well yea i basically couldn't see shit for most of this mod lmao).labsthe labs are quite easy (as compared to 2030/2040) and if you get a nice lab tutor, he/she may even give you some answers lol. try to score close to full marks in thisassignmentsthere are 3 assignments in total, 1 before recess week, 2 after recess week. i find the assignments quite tough and usually will spend >3 days on it. try to score close to full marks in this as wellmidterms & finalsvery hard. need to do questions both fast & accurately. there's a lot of questions and due to the nature of the content, it is very easy to make careless mistakes which cascade down and affect other questions. there's also no error carry forward so if you make a careless mistake somewhere, and your end answer is wrong, whole question = 0 marks. for finals the mrq is also, either select all correct options or get 0 marks. i was busy with my other mods and got absolutely wrecked for midterms and finals lmao.if anyone is reading this worrying that they will fail (because that's me when after i finished my 2100 finals), don't worry as long as you put in effort and score close to full marks for assignments + labs + tutorials, i think prof will try to give you the minimum passing grade like me..but of course still try your best hahahahas you can see i sort of gave up on this mod, don't be like me. practise more and stay on top of your content. this mod really need a lot of practisesee more 30 replyshare ›show more replies −+bbruh 6 months ago

finalworkloadwise, this module has light to moderate workload. unlike other cs modules, it has little to no programming assignments (which i am not particularly strong at) except some simple c-programming assignments, and most of lab and homeworks can be done within an hour. handful of students are intimidated with the amount of contents but most part of the slides are exemplars, and in fact, the amount of pure contents is not too much. as long as you ""understand"" how the machine works, you barely need memorization in this module.lectures: lectures are uploaded on friday night and the students are expected to watch the lectures and complete the online quiz every week. lectures sometimes are only 1 hour but sometimes, the lecture is 3+ hours long, so it really depends on what the contents are for that particular week. lecture contents were clearly presented for all 4 profs who recorded the video.tutorial: i met the best tutor so far in nus cs module. my tutor, a/p wong weng fai, is a very engaging and interactive instructor where he encourages students to present the questions, and even though one did not try tutorial questions beforehand, he allows the students to work out the questions on the spot. one might feel this gives a pressure, but for me, this worked out really well since prof weng fai guided me to solve the problems wherever i got stuck on the questions, and while presenting the solutions, i really learned a lot without taking my time to revisit the materials. tutorial session was my revision session, and thanks to the prof, i did not need to revise much before exams as i already internalized the key concepts via tutorial presentation and his guidance.exams: exams were the worst part of this module. they are terriblely designed. i strongly believe that well-designed exam should 1) assess student's conceptual understanding, 2) assess student's ability to apply the knowledge, and 3) assess student's ability to think critically and creatively. both midterms and finals failed to attain any three key goals above. the questions were very computational that every question feels like they are either assessing the speed of converting binary to hexadecimal or vice versa, or how quick students can type in 0/1 s for cache especially. this is just... ""non-sensical"", badly designed exams. i saw the past papers and they were focusing heavily on conceptual understanding, applications and critical thinking skills, but our batch papers were just pure binary hexadecimal calculations for every qns which i really disliked. even though i did very well for the midterms (idk about finals since we did not receive the result), i strongly disagree that these kinds of exams should be used to assess students' understanding of the course materials.usefulness: 7/10 enjoyment: 6/10 difficulty: 4/10 see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+jjasting 984

(isa)datapathcontrolboolean algebralogic gatessimplificationcombinational circuitsmedium-scale integration (msi) components: decoders, encoders, multiplexers, demultiplexerssequential logic: latches and flip flopspipeliningcachefinal exam topics: allthoughts: i don’t really find most of the topics that difficult, it’s just mostly tedious and time-consuming, especially if you’re doing things manually. we were lucky to not really need to do things that manually in that we could use excel or internet calculators to do karnaugh maps from boolean algebra/simplification and stuff like that for our online exam but in a physical exam, it would probably take a long time because it needs to be done manually. regardless, there were still a lot of things that needed to be tediously done by hand step by step like pipelining and cache. still, these felt like mostly mindless routine tasks, kind of like being a human calculator; you don’t really need to thing that much, they’re just tedious. probably the only one where you really need to think is the combinational circuits/msi components part where given a desired mapping from some inputs to some outputs, you need to figure out how to combine circuit components that would give those outputs when fed the respective inputs, but that’s probably one of the only hard topics. so i consider this mod easy because it’s mostly mindless, but it’s kind of moderate difficulty because it’s tedious and time-consuming stuff, and you might get careless because of the numerous steps involved.lecturers: both the lecturers are very good, always helpful and friendly, and they explain really well. i had no issues with either of them.tutor: song kai is very friendly and he’s quite familiar with what he is teaching so he’s a good tutor.lab instructor: aakanksha is always friendly and helpful, she will answer your questions on the lab without giving away the answers of course and she was good at helping to guide students to the right answers.labs: all you do here is apply what you learned in lectures and actually did them somewhat. so the first lab was just some c programming, the next three were on mips (actually a simulation called spim), then one on processors (simulation designed by prof ad), three on building simple circuits using components and a breadboard (but fancier) called the logic trainer, then two on building more complex circuits using a simulation software called logisim (likely because doing this by hand would be really cumbersome). honestly, it was quite fun, and kind of made me want to do comp eng to get more of these hands-on kind of stuff. just make sure to check your answers for the labs, they’re really easy, and your lab ta may hint whether you got it wrong or not, so that you don’t lose out in this component because it’s quite easy to score full marks for the lab component.midterm: it was basically open everything, so i think almost everybody was collaborating. i wanted to collab too so that i didn’t lose out to those who were but at the same time, i didn’t want to collab either because i realised from my earlier cs 1231 quiz 1 that i couldn’t focus if i can hear people talking, which of course happens when collabing. in the end, i told my friends i wanted to collab with them but it was too late, they didn’t see my message, so i basically did the test alone. it was alright though because the midterm was quite easy, so i did pretty well despite doing it alone. of course, i was unable to score full marks because i could not discuss with people to spot my careless mistakes but at least i was above average iirc. also, because it was open everything yet the test could be done alone, the average score was pretty high, which was why i was only above average.assignments: this was not open-collaboration but they weren’t difficult so doing them alone was alright. i got full marks for the first one but not for the last two; i just had a few careless mistakes while doing them, mostly because i did them, then didn’t have the time to check again because i was overloading and i had no time. regardless, i still scored almost full marks because they weren’t difficult. the first assignment was on c, number systems, and mips; the second was on boolean algebra, logic gates, simplification, and combinational circuits; the third extends the topics in the second with additional topics of msi components and sequential logic. iirc, we were given 1 week to do each assignment and they were given in weeks 5, 9, and 11. most people probably score full marks here so if you have time, just check your answers properly.final exam: the profs said this was the same format as the midterm so we all assumed it was open-everything again. it really was not difficult but it was super time-consuming. i think this exam was impossible to complete if done alone. luckily, i decided to tell my friends i was collabing with them much earlier this time unlike during midterms. as a result, i think i did quite well at this too. not sure how this would work in a physical exam but i guess my advice is to probably prepare a good help sheet because there’s a lot of things to remember and just keep practicing until you can do things fast because it’s mostly how fast you can do the tedious mindless things with no errors. this probably applies to a physical midterm as well.see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+zai 6 months agoay 24/25 sem 1(aaron tan, wong weng fai, anandha gopalan)having completed the trinity of cs mods (cs 2030 s, cs 2040 s, cs 2100), i find this to be the most content-heavy out of the three, but honestly, the most manageable for people with no experience pre-nus (i found 2030 s much more manageable in general, especially with the practicals).in comparison:workload: cs 2040 s < cs 2030 s < cs 2100 complexity: cs 2100 < cs 2030 s < cs 2040 sdidn't watch any recitations, and was generally a week ahead of the syllabus through pre-reading everything, and generally that was a good strategy, due to the blended format.administratively - this mod was not the best, but i genuinely think the teaching team gets way too much flak. finals had mistakes here and there, but them being transparent with the marking meant i actually was able to check the marking (i added 8 marks to my finals here, and 3 marks to midterms after review... that's a whole grade...)my feedback would be the labs are fun - i think it would be more impactful if they were more difficult - and had longer time. it feels like the real-world restrictions could have been a good way to test simplification in a more practical way for the logic circuits, for example!weightage was 50% finals (58.5/73/82), 20% midterms (21/25/29.5 /40), and the rest are kinda free (assignments, labs, tutorials). finals this year was much easier than previous semesters (and the stats indicate such), but the midterms was similar to the previous sem, so perhaps the cohort is just getting stronger.expected grade: a (~88%)see more 10 replyshare ›−+zaizai 5 months agoactual grade: a. bell curve was tight this time, so ymmv for different years!see more 10

together with cs 2030 s and cs 2040 s, and somehow i got the best grade in cs 2100 out of the trinity. i guess the content isn't that hard, it's just a race for time in the exams.tutorials are very useful. a lot of past year questions are gone through. do attempt them before the lesson. labs are quite useless, but they are 10% so you should still strive for full marks. labs are copied from the previous year so if you have a senior just ask them for the answers.there are 3 assignments spread out over the semester. almost everyone gets full marks because it is a take-home assignment. you have about one week to submit them. i accidentally lost some marks in the last assignment as i was careless.midterms was okay, though the last question had more than one-quarter of the total marks so many students (including me) did not do very well due to poor time management. finals really killed a lot of people, the questions were very time consuming and the ""easier"" questions were shoved at the back of the paper. the average for the exam was below 50%. thankfully, i was able to complete the paper.main tips are to do lots of timed practices. there are a lot of past year papers. the format of the finals is very predictable, for example there will always be one mips question, with the same code (usually) used for the next question on pipelining, and then the cache question. there will also be a question on sequential circuits / combinational circuit and msi components (which is more of an iq test imo, either you get it or you don't). there are some tricks to do pipelining / cache questions faster, pay close attention during recitations as the prof will usually share some tips.closing remarks: i think trinity isn't too difficult if you have a strong understanding of oop + dsa (and thus have extra bandwidth to take this module). it also lets you take cs 2106 earlier, in case you are interested in the higher-level modules / want to clear them during exchange.components:quiz:

in a hybrid format with pre-recorded lectures and a weekly 2 hour recitation to review the lesson and have a qna session. after a few weeks, the qna was changed slightly so that you’d have to get your questions in before the day of the rec so that better answers could be prepared for all. it worked well enough, though my short attention span often made the lecture watching take much longer than it should’ve. i always attended the rec f 2 f, so i never got to encounter prof ravi. imo prof colin was a great lecturer and prof prabhu was good too.labs had to be done before the session itself, where the ta would just check your work. most labs can be done within 1-2 hrs iirc. in the later labs, you would be able to put a circuit together on a breadboard irl which was kinda cool. both assignments can be done within a day. lecture quizzes can be done within 30 minutes iirc if you understand the lecture videos properly. as with most mods i’ve taken so far, most people scored well for the ca components (the median for assignment 2 was 40/40 lmao), so most of the difference in our grades came from the midterm and finals.there were unfortunately some issues with typos in the midterms due to a last minute change from examplify to pen(cil) and paper, but thankfully it wasn’t too much of an issue. the profs also gave everyone some bonus marks to make up for it. midterms consisted of 25 multiple choice items. the curve was steep, with the 5 number summary being 4/18/20/22/25 and a mean of 19.5906. the finals was examplify + pen(cil) and paper. there were more multiple choice items in examplify, while the written component consisted entirely of circuit items. i near maxed my ca components like others and did just alright for midterms. i felt that i messed up finals a bit so i was expecting a-, but then many people i talked to had some trouble with the finals too and my actual grade also ended up being a, so i guess that everyone died a bit there.pre-sem target: aexpected:

conversion tools.heres a big fat tip on how to convert between bases easily, which should also serve as a good link to cs 1231 s (and also cylic groups, but you dont need to know this):radix/ diminished radix calculations are just modulo operations. consider a 4 bit 1 s complement representation. then addition between two 4-bit numbers is just addition across modulo (2^4 - 1). also, you can find similar rules for any radix/diminished radix.see this pdf:http://www.cs.cornell.edu/c...it was such a shame that colin only taught us how to do base-b arithmetic through rote memorisation, perhaps due to the need to cram so much content into so little time.addendum:judging by reviews below, most people found this mod to be intellectually easy, but tedious. if you are good, you should be able to put in the effort to understand the theory behind the computations. this will help with your understanding and help you cut down on computation time and reduce the ""luck factor"" involved to be accurate. the example i gave on radix/diminished radix calculations is one of them.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+mario lorenzo 5 years agotaken in ay 19/20 sem 2 (covid

while the second half discusses more about boolean algebra, logic circuits, msi components, sequential logic, pipelining, and cache. personally, i enjoy the topics regarding to logic circuits and boolean algebra more compared to architecture and datapath.the first half is being taught by dr. adi. he is a great lecturer in explaining the concepts albeit sometime i find him too slow. his explanation is very detailed and elementary so it's suitable for various kinds of students. the rest is being taught by prof aaron, the legendary prof in soc :d. he engages the class very well, even

simple single-threaded microcontroller.  this module does not cover multithreading or operating systems, which is covered in cs 2106.  the first few weeks also introduce basic c programming - no prior knowledge in c is assumed.  those who are already fluent in c or c++ will find these lectures to be revision.there is a mix of content (pipelining, caching, processor datapath and control) and logical reasoning (boolean algebra, karnaugh maps) in this module.prof aaron is a good lecturer who tries his best to engage students during lectures and tutorials.  weekly tutorials are usually conducted by undergraduate or postgraduate students who have taken this module, but i was fortunate to have prof aaron as my tutor.  there are weekly lab sessions, which usually require students to prepare something on their laptops before showing it to their lab ta for grading.midterms and finals are closed-book (with help sheet).  there are no group projects for this module.see more 10 replyshare

the other trinity components, this module is more content heavy with slightly easier content imo. the volume of content can be a lot at times, but the calculations are (generally) simpler. the lecture videos are prerecorded in multiple parts, and can be extremely lengthy (i swear some weeks it was 4 h+ of recorded content). the lecture period was instead converted into a recitation which i didn’t attend, but there was a zoom option. the textbook also isn’t necessary.tutorial attendance is graded, so you probably will go anyway. the ta goes through the tutorial questions. labs on the other hand, can be completed in 15 minutes (or even before going). for the first few you just have to show the ta your code and submit your lab sheet then you can leave. for the later labs you have to build circuits with the logic trainer which i found to be quite fun although a bit annoying at times. so for planning purposes be aware that tutorials usually take the full time while labs generally finish quickly.i suppose this is part of the buildup for cs 2106. learning mips was interesting although having to code in it was not the best. the later chapters on circuit design and concepts such as pipelining and cache were also interesting although being tested on them was a different experience. i enjoyed the lab sessions and finding out about different components such as encoders and

content was up to mips control, so the short answers are usually of similar formats to past year papers, such as tracing the inputs / outputs when certain instructions are run, encoding / decoding instructions, counting number of instructions, etc. it is openbook, so you don’t have to worry about having to memorise content. aaron trolled and made the first page of mcq extremely hard (they were the 3 questions with the lowest scores). i felt the short answer was very straightforward on the other hand.finals: 50%if you do the practice papers they are pretty brutal, and the time crunch is real. format is quite straightforward, mcq (in later years) followed by some mips code. they first test that you understand it (how many instructions will run, what is the output, translate it to c) etc., then ask a pipelining question using it (with/without forwarding, early branching, branch prediction) followed by a cache question (hitrate etc.). then there’s a combinational circuit design question, which is an iq test because some of the solutions are quite hard to come up with. also there’s a sequential circuit question, which is really just truth table bashing so it is very straightforward. take advantage of the fact that it is open book, and prepare empty truth tables, k-map templates, pipelining tables to make your life easier.the paper is an average prof aaron paper, so there’s traps everywhere and mcq can be quite troll (there was a question testing logisim symbols). since open ended is short answer, you don’t get to show your working and it is essentially binary marking. if you misread the mips question and get one part wrong it often cascades into the entire question being wrong. the mips code took the branch, and skipped every other element which caught a lot of people off guard. i had to redo my entire pipelining because i realised it took the branch after finishing that part, and had to redo my entire cache because i forgot it skipped elements until the last 5 minutes of the exam.workload: 6/10 enjoyability: 7/10 difficulty: 6/10 gradestutorial attendance: 10/10 (mean: 9.46, 1/10/10/10/10)quizzes: 3/3 (mean: 2.81, 0/3/3/3/3)assignment 1: 39/40

aaron tan, prabhu natarajanenjoyability: 2 / 5 workload: 3 / 5 what an interesting roller coaster ride! this module is infamous for being one of the most annoying modules among trinity modules, and it actually is. since all video contents were pre recorded, it’s recommended to stay ahead of the lecture a week or two, especially when you took it with cs 2030 s and cs 2040 s (in case you want to take trinity)now, let’s talk about the module itself. the content before the midterm was a whirlwind tour to number systems, c programming, and mips processor. i really loved how the lecturer spent two weeks on mips since it’s very relevant to what we might encounter in the future. moreover, these topics were pretty fascinating for me, and i actually enjoyed every bit (no pun intended) of them and i expected to keep this feeling until the end of this semester. not until i opened some past year's midterm papers, i then realized that the difficulty of this module did not come from the content itself, but the awkwardness of how these concepts were tested. luckily, this semester’s midterm paper is not that bad. the median was also really high this semester (26.5/40).for the second half of the semester, we were introduced to boolean algebra, combinatorial circuits, msi components, and sequential circuits. personally, i found this section to be a little dry due to its nature of the subject and i found these topics to be disconnected to what i’d learned during the first half. though, the tutorial questions where you have to design the circuits (except sequential circuit) were really fun (kind of iq test).here comes the last part of the module, and for me, one of the hardest topics: pipelining and cache. not only do these topics have a lot of content to cover, but the lecturer only spent one week on each, and of course, it was during the last two weeks of the course.until this part, i had a neutral opinion on this module: the general content was not that bad, slightly annoying, but it’s doable. but you might have forgotten one thing, this is the prof aaron module. his exams were pretty infamous. things started to get downhill when i attempted the pyp for final exams. i still remember myself sitting at clb and starting to attempt the final pyp, and oh man, what on earth i had to deal with. the final exam was not only tedious to its core, but also consisted of tricky counting questions. sometimes, i might have more chances of winning a lottery than precisely counting the number of cache hits and tracing pipelining clock cycles. i knew that there had been a lot of complaints regarding the exam design, but i didn’t expect it to be this bad. luckily, i had some friends taking this module, making the grinding process more doable. after finishing the finals, my opinion on this module is downright negative. personally, i found this year's paper slightly more difficult than pyp. i didn’t finish the paper on time.grading componentsweightage was 50% finals, 20% midterms, and the rest were assignments, labs, and tutorials that most people got almost full marks.resultsfull marks for quizzes and tutorialsassignments 1

are a lot of things that could be improved in the next iterations of this module. i don’t think it’s a good idea to teach students mips a long while ago before reintroducing the concept at the end of the semester with pipelining. other than that, the teaching quality is really great and i do not have any issues with it.for the exam, considering the fact that this had been a point of complaint for a while and the lecturer hadn't attempted to resolve the issue, maybe it was actually difficult to create an exam that truly assesses student understanding in two hours. maybe it's not a bad thing to leave the nature of the course as it is.it’s for me one of the most memorable modules as a freshman :)expected grade:a/a+see more 00 replyshare ›−+sodium_is_not_a_catsodium_is_not_a_cat 3 days

review, there are around 4-5 h of pre-recorded lectures to watch every week on top of the weekly lecture slot (recitation), and ensuring you understand everything could take even longer.thinking back,

into 13 weeks.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ccheesefishballs 6 months agoediteday 24/25 sem 1 aaron tan, wong weng fai, anandha gopalanthis is a content-heavy module. this module operates on a hybrid learning mode; there are around 4-5 hours worth of pre-recorded lecture videos to watch at your own time per week and the lecture slot is replaced with a recitation to revise the content taught from those videos.attendance for recitation is not graded so you may choose to skip it. however, i do feel that it offers some value in covering gaps in your content knowledge as the lecturers do a good job in explaining the content from the ground up.based on reviews here and on reddit, the midterms were not very well-received by some students. a large proportion of the marks came from mcq. there were unusually more questions related to c programming as compared to past year papers. one model answer (""so that wires do not cross over each other in the diagram"") was also seen as nonsensical, though technically correct.the scope for the final exam was broken down as such: 30% from first half of the content, 70% from second half. it was quite doable as compared to past year papers.admin-wise, i have had a hard time finding certain resources like the midterm solutions because they were found attached under the conversation inbox on canvas. ideally, this should have been uploaded to the files section in the course page on canvas. apart from this, i appreciate the fact that they were transparent about grade distribution for finals and had revealed how the cohort had performed for each question.as someone who is not used to this hybrid teaching style, i found it quite painful to watch 4 hours worth of lecture videos per week (even at 1.5 x speed). it is important to do so consistently, otherwise this amount would snowball and you would find yourself cram 20+ hours of videos right before midterms/finals.this module allows you to tinker around hardware during lab sessions which i found to be quite enjoyable.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+cchong chin herng 10 months agotaken in ay 22/23 sem 2 under aaron tan tuck choy, colin tan kheng

like the content is stuff that i find mildly interesting but can't be bothered to study to a level where i would be comfortable being tested on. because the exams contain some of the dumbest questions i've ever had the (dis)pleasure of doing.the vast majority of exam questions fall into two categories. the first is boolean algebra. this i find pretty nice actually, and some of the questions on combinational/sequential circuits are in fact quite fun. the second type of question, however, is effectively just arithmetic. these include stuff like converting decimals between different bases, converting decimals to ieee-754 floating point format, translating mips instructions in 32 bit strings, counting isa instructions, counting cycles in pipelining, counting the number of cache hits/misses, etc. if you excel at counting sheep this is your time to shine. otherwise glhf trying to do all this in the exam. for this sem the boolean algebra questions were all at the back of the

to them, not much to say there. most tutorial questions were not easy and taken from pyps. the approaches/methods to questions in the tutorials will help for exams.canvas quizzes: 3%every week, there’s a recorded past-year lecture to watch (or 2, or 3). i survived the first half of the semester just reading through the slides instead of spending the time to watch lecture recordings, but eventually couldn’t keep up/understand the slides fast enough so i resorted to watching the lectures at 2 x speed. only after watching the lectures could i attempt the quizzes. some quizzes had unlimited attempts, others had max of 3 or 10 attempts. expect to spend maybe 30 mins a week (after finishing the lectures, which could be 2 h a week). the quiz questions and a recap of the topic are covered during a recitation (lecture slot on the timetable) that is 2 h a week.3 assignments: 12%this is a good way to force yourself to keep up with the lecture/tutorial content. each assignment some questions from recently taught topics, and the median was always very high. difficulty was not high, being similar to tutorials/lecture examples, just tedious and easy to make careless mistakes in. an annoyance with these assignments is that they are in the format of canvas quizzes, with some questions having manual marking and others automatic, and the automatically marked questions have no room for variation (such as spaces between letters and punctuation).labs: 10%this seems to be a simple copy-paste from year to year, only that lab 7 varies between multiplexer/demultiplexer and encoder/decoder. going in person for the lab session is only for submission of the lab report, and demonstration of any code/circuit/diagram as required in the lab report. ensure your code works/circuit drawing is complete before going. for some of the circuit design labs, the hardware to test the design on was wonky, so plan to spend a bit longer for those labs.midterm test: 20%timing (6.30 pm) aside, this test was not easy but also not immensely difficult. it was on examplify, which is annoying and slow for a few reasons: a) it’s very painful to read 16 or 32 bit binary numbers on screen. there are no magnification/accessibility options and my eyes hurt after. i resorted to using the onscreen highlighter (how generous!) to highlight groups of 4 numbers to ensure that i did not miss anything. b) just like the assignments on canvas, there’s no room for variation in your answers, in terms of spacing or however else. c) there would be no working or partial marks. d) you have to draw/do your own working on pencil and paper anyway. e) it takes forever for the whole exam hall to submit their scripts to the server. f) the questions are numbered 1-17, but the first 10 or so were mcq and the last few questions were long, open-ended questions (which was a bit deceptive because i didn’t look all the way to end before starting). all that aside, the median was around 60% (24/40) and there was barely enough time to finish, although it wasn’t immensely more difficult than past year papers.final exam: 50%somewhat like midterms, but longer (2 h). this paper was a little more difficult than most past year papers (though what’s with the trend of not releasing last ay’s papers? or answer schemes for most of the papers posted to the website?) and i did not manage to finish. it tests most of the syllabus, with 15 mcq questions testing mostly earlier topics. there is 1 multiple part open-ended question on msi components, which is normally a fancy-looking iq test (a measure of how fast you are able to spot patterns in truth tables) though was simpler this year. there is 1 question on flip-flops, which is somewhat of a giveaway so long as you don’t mind spending the time drawing the truth table and k-maps (on that note, bring printed, blank truth tables and k-maps to save time). and then there are 3 long questions using one set of mips code – the first one tests the mips code content (can take a lot of time, but essential to understand to help with caching), the next pipelining (do enough pyps and you’ll get the trends/rules), and caching (this is quite difficult, especially for data cache, if you have multiple arrays being iterated through at different rates). generally really tedious, very easy to make careless mistakes at any part, and a breathless race against time (i did not manage to finish the paper).general comments:time consuming – if you do tutorials beforehand and attend recitations, expect to spend over 8 hours a week on this module, excluding assignments.content was heavy – there isn’t a single topic that was light and easy to understand. maybe isa was relatively lightweight, or boolean algebra (especially if you’ve taken cs 1231/s), but particularly in isa, the assessments have a way of twisting questions far beyond what’s seen on the slides that make it difficult to be certain you’re correctcomments on some topics:pipelining is a bit difficult to get a grasp on, but after doing pyps i just found a set of rules to stick to, since it’s fairly predictable. for that reason, i didn’t draw much on pipelining tables.i never really got the purpose of learning c syntaxmips encoding in binary is painful and easy to be careless in, but you’ll get plenty of practicei found isa interesting and applicable to the real world. the same can be said with data path and control pathcombinatorial circuits/msi components are an iq testcaching can be difficult to grasp at first, but at least the instruction cache questions were quite doable. data cache, on the other hand…concluding words: this is a heavy and tedious course. there is not a single aspect/topic that is easy. expect to spend a lot of time and get

(last minute mugging?) the content, especially datapath, sequential logic and state machines.absolutely hated the assessment format. 50% of the marks are allocated to the most annoying type of questions, like 1. how many times is this line mips code executed 2. tracing out the mips code (with loops lord help me lol) for a full pipeline state with/without forwarding and with/without early branch assumption (which all result in different rules to trace out the pipeline) and the state of cache with/without associativitylike god lmao is it that hard to set a less mind-numbing/brain-rotting paper? there's so much other content in both cache and pipelining that could be tested which doesnt necessitate this kind of bull.it really isn't the case that the profs are unable to create well-designed questions as well. midterms tested on the data/control path implementation for the j instruction - which we did not learn but if you understood control signals well you could refer to their diagram and answer the question. as for finals, the datapath + pipeline question which tested on the registers and control signals used for forwarding (which we were not taught) relied on students to synthesise and infer patterns in the pipeline registers based on the diagram they provided - this is 1. not a question that is pure tedium and 2. required us to combine knowledge learnt from different topics. why couldn't have this been the case for the questions on pipelining and cache? i do not know.either ways it might've been my fault as well, went in the finals at 5 pm with zero sleep after having rawdogged a 9 am exam on the same day. did study for pipeline and cache but didn't bother to actually learn how to trace out the state of the cache/pipeline (i gave up on that lol). turns out it was near 50% of the finals and i just wrote garbage for them while trying not to piss or defecate myself or breakdown from the pressure (pipeline: guessed random numbers,

pre-recorded lectures could have up to 6 hours of content. this module ate a lot of my time, especially since i was struggling with understanding everything (particularly after midterms) so many rewatches were done. you can watch videos from nesoacademy, intermation, organic chem tutor etc. to really supplement your understanding because i strongly feel that prof aaron's explanations kinda jumps many steps and makes it difficult to keep upthe content felt really dry, i came in thinking that i would be interested but boi, was i in for a ride. combination circuits was basically an iq test to see if you could spot patterns and understanding how different gates were used to form a function was especially difficult for me. any enjoyment for the module was sucked away by the sheer amount of content to go through. that being said, learning about mips and pipelining was interesting.gripe #2: the second assignment was ""silently"" released with no heads up on sunday, leading up to week 13. granted it served as ""good revision"", there was basically no announcement to tell us that it was going to be released.with regards to recitations, i would highly recommend attending those conducted by prof trevor or aaron, both physical. prof trevor's were especially interesting since he brings in his past experience on combi circuits etc.tutorials, i did not do my tutorials at all since i was too lost, i mainly attended for attendance and tried to grasp any little bit of understanding i could get. my tutorial ta was really nice and patient, always answering questions that i had.labs, were basically hi/bye since the tas were just there to check on your work. labs do have to be printed out, which i think is a waste of paper, but not too troublesome since labs were at com 1. towards the latter part of the semester, labs involved using the breadboard, which was interesting and does kind of help with bettering understanding about combi circuits. you can always check a certain hub for help if you're struggling.tests(both on examplify)midterms was pretty difficult for me. i think i was caught off guard by how many number conversion questions there were so i ended up failing. i was also definitely caught off guard by the fact that the format was completely different from what was announced. there was supposed to 16 questions in the announcement, but there ended up being 22 i believe.meanwhile, finals was really easy. the paper tested mainly on application based questions, so if you did enough pyps, it should be manageable.please take this mod with friendsi would also like to thank prof aaron for setting up a sets qna for his recitation for us to ask questions, it came in clutch since i didn't need to dig into lecture slides for the lecture qna.

assignments 14% - labs 20% - midterms 50% - finalsthere are two aspects to this module, just like any other module. the content, and the administration. the content was alright, the administration was a downright pain.lectures are to be watched the week before we cover the content in tutorials / recitations. so we watch pre-recorded lectures in our own time, and then the profs use the lecture slot to conduct a recitation instead, where they cover the content again briefly and then address any questions students might have. this is already about 6 hours of work. on top of this, there is also a one hour lab and a one hour tutorial.the labs are pretty chill, you just submit a printout of your lab assignment and submit for the most part, except on a few days where we work with a breadboard. as someone mentioned below, it's quite odd that a computer science module in 2023 still expects us to submit a hard-copy of a lab assignment, but oh well.the tutorials are hard. i had no idea what was going on for the most part. it's like they teach (2 + 2) in the lectures and then ask you to calculate the mass of the sun in tutorials.i found the content fun for the most part. some of the number stuff can get quite annoying, especially base conversion and radix complement. i think most people find this module quite dry, but if you find processors, assembly language and circuits interesting, this module might be fun for you and i really enjoyed it as well, especially parts with the sequential and combinational circuits as they tend to be quite big-brain.now for the admin part. many aspects of this module are downright annoying. the print-outs for lab submissions, pre-watching the lectures, an assignment due at the end of week 13, not to mention the fact that the final exam is on examplify. once you're knee deep in cs 2100, you'll realise it's a lot of drawing. you'll want to trace circuit lines to figure out the output, and you'll want to draw a pipeline table for pipeline delays. you can't do any of that when the paper is on examplify. it just seems like they are making it unnecessarily hard for us in a way that does not benefit our understanding of the concepts at all.i think our midterm was quite easy but i wasn't really focusing i guess, and i ended up being one mark below the median. median was 16/22, upper quartile was 18/22. the good thing is that since midterm is only 20%, you can always make a comeback in the finals. i think i was able to do quite well for finals. however do be warned, one mistake in the final could affect multiple questions that come after and you'll have to be really careful. this module involves a lot of tedious calculations.my score breakdown:tutorial attendance 1% / 1%quizzes 5% / 5%assignment 1 5% / 5%assignment 2 grade

though there are techniques. i rather like the mips topic as it was more textbook style and it was learning what a processor made up of which was what i had no clue beforehand!topics like pipelining and cache were cool, though questions can be difficult or easy.mid terms were easy and standard, the median was quite moderately high. labs were just time for tas to check your work and i really enjoyed tinkering around the circuit boards :). final was hard though, the combinational circuit question (first question) was pretty challenging, and the sequential circuit was manageable but the phrasing was long. the paper was conducted on examplify which was worse compared to physical since students can highlight or trace the circuit paths. but it turned out fine overall.difficulty: 6-7/10

hardest, but the sheer amount of topics taught and the accumulative difficulty is no joke. this will be much easier if you played with c language beforehand, or redstone circuits in minecraft lmao.it gets much better after midterms though.workload: 8/10 again, workload is basically due to the amount of topics, and therefore the lectures, quizzes, labs and tutorials that follows it. after a while, i gave up on keeping up with the lectures and going into tutorials with the bare minimum. not recommended since tutorials are quite important to gauge your understanding.experience: 7/10 might be due to the migration to canvas, along with the change into hybrid lectures (you watch web lectures at your own pace, then recitation in the lecture slots), the experience is not that enjoyable. recitation is a giant q&a with the explanation of past quizzes, which doesn't feel that useful. the profs worked hard, but i feel that the questions have a lot of ambiguity, like there isn't a proof-reader for it.i also disliked how a minor careless mistake will cost you the entire question marks to be lost, despite this module needing you to manually calculate or design circuits. also the finals are crazy hard to do given the 2 h time constraint and there is just no time to check your answers, following my previous point on careless mistakes.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+kkok 3 years

together with friends. i would caution other future freshmen who are considering taking this in y 1 s 1 because of exemptions against doing so. this semester, there were very few spots for the module on modreg after round 0, so if you manage to snag the module in y 1 s 1 (where you can only modreg from round 1) it’s likely that you’re doing this alone.assessment:- 5% canvas quizzes- 1% tutorial attendance- 2 x 5% assignments- 14% labs- 20% midterms- 50% finalsmidterms and finals are both pretty standard, there won’t really be any surprises. the difficulty level for the assignments, labs, and exams were all about similar. the bell curve is quite steep though, at least for midterms the iqr was 18-20-22 out of 25.content:there is a ton of content (24 lecture chapters!!) in this module, but i concur with other reviewers that the module is “intellectually easy but tedious”. imo the topics are ordered in a weird way, going from higher-level (c, assembly) then gradually down (datapath, control path) to boolean algebra / logic gates / simplification, then back up again to building larger circuits, pipelining, and caching. the result of this is that at least for me, around the middle of the course the topics felt very disjoint and i couldn’t see how each additional topic contributed to my understanding of computer organization. it was only when we reached the end (especially pipelining) when i could finally see the big picture.the labs are really fun and my favourite part of the module. you really get to apply the concepts you just learned to solve interesting-enough problems. the lab sessions themselves generally only last 5 minutes – the labs are released a week in advance, so you just bring your completed lab sheet, show some demo on your laptop to the ta, and you can leave. you must print and staple the lab sheets before bringing them to class, which i found bizarre for a university module in 2022.all in all, i think the content is important and useful for both future cs mods and in industry.teaching:the pre-recorded lectures are delivered by both dr colin and dr prabhu, with slides by prof aaron tan who teaches this module in semester 2. the slides and the lectures are pretty good, albeit a bit overwhelming in number. i didn’t get to watch all of them due to time constraints, but they’re interesting enough that i’ve downloaded them to watch slowly over the december holidays.the lecturers are also fairly active on a module-wide telegram channel, which is impressive.i did not attend tutorials and recitations, but it seems that a lot of effort is put into those by the lecturers. there was a bit of a kerfuffle in the first half of the semester where the lecturers said they would stop uploading recorded recitations, but i think it was resolved amicably.lab tas mostly exist to just physically receive your lab reports and grade them. that said, they did do some teaching when we were introduced to the logic trainer (breadboard thingy), and were very helpful when i was lost at the start (i didn’t take physics).see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ddisqus_oj 3 mnqr 4 cp 3 years agoediteday 21/22 sem 2 professors: aaron tan tuck

the logic trainer (like building circuits on a breadboard), and also get to use logisim, which is a software to build circuits. assignments are not difficult, but you need to make sure you are careful

to past iterations of the module, including c programming, mips, processors, cache, logic gates, and combinatorial & sequential circuits.lectures were recorded for this semester. uncle soo is a really great lecturer who always tries to make his lectures engaging for his students, but sadly, he mentioned in his last lecture that he won’t be taking this module anymore :(labs and tutorials were conducted by a mix of undergraduate and postgraduate students. there were no physical labs for this semester due to oversubscription of the module, and thus the labs for this semester made use of the software named digital. since students could leave the zoom calls after completing their demos, most lab sessions lasted for not more than 8 minutes. the tutorials were conducted in a similar manner as most other cs modules.the workload for the module is somewhat lower than cs 2030/s and cs 2040/s. midterm and finals were both closed-book, but cheatsheets were allowed.see more 00 replyshare ›show

much need to use it. mips (using qtspim) is featured more, especially at the labs, but you will need to understand how to convert mips to c and vice-versa for other written assessments.concepts wise, you can imagine learning a somewhat unrelated and new topic every week, which is difficult and not easy to process. my cheat sheet for this module is the longest out of all other cs mods that i have taken (as of y 2 s 2).workload: moderately heavy. the tutorials are 1 h every week. the questions are doable but still take some time to finish; even then, the concepts taught still require a bit of time to digest.the weekly lab sessions do not last for one hour - usually, you can complete these at home, then show them to your tutor in session for the mark, and you can leave within ten minutes. on the later half of the semester, you'll be playing with wires and chips (which is really fun!) but will take slightly longer to complete (and if you don't prepare, will probably take longer than one hour).additionally, if you do not keep up with content, it is very easy to get lost (even missing one lecture is a great cost - note that it's split to a 2+1 h lecture). prioritise this in terms of weekly upkeep to stay afloat.grade weightage:5% class attendance for tutorials 12% assignments (x 3)13% labs (x 10)20% midterms 50% finalsskip lecture?: hell no, attending uncle soo's lecture helps

admin problems.additional comments: looking at the past year papers, when this module is under prof aaron, expect a tough time - his papers wear you down and are unlikely to be completable within 2 h.

aaron said that nobody has ever said they liked both parts of the module, so let me be the first to say that, yes, i actually enjoyed both parts of it.the first half of cs 2100 starts with boolean logic and algebra, numerical system and encoding (turning numbers into binary), and tools like k-maps which are used to tackle complex boolean expressions. with this foundation, we learn logic gates (and, or, xor, etc.) and how they can be used to implement basic components such as adders, and from these very basic building blocks create medium and large scale logic and processor units. this is the lowest level you'll go to as part of a cs degree, unless you take an electrical engineering module, and it is very enlightening, because it shows how from fundamental components we can build complex thinking machines - functional abstraction turns up a lot in logic design. boolean algebra is also useful, since binary will come up again in a lot of places in cs, and it pays to be familiar with them.the second half of the module covers mips processor design, architecture and programming. this part starts with learning the mips instruction format and how they correspond to certain high(er) level language constructs - in essence, learning very basic compiler design. then, using a simplified model of the mips processor we are shown how the processor translates mips assembly language into binary which the processor then executes (the datapath). finally pipelining (executing multiple parts of different instructions simultaneously), branch prediction and caching is introduced to speed up the processor. all of these are important concept because they are applicable elsewhere - http pipelining is used by browsers speed up the loading of websites, for instance, and caching reappears as memoization in higher level programming.mr aaron is a good speaker, and though personally i didn't like his style, many of my friends enjoyed attending his lectures. i found them to be a tad slow. i feel that i learned the most from tutorials, which are challenging, but not overly difficult. their difficulty level and format are also similar to the exams, so doing them also helped to prepare for them. pacing throughout the module is fairly even, if (in my opinion) a little slow.assignments and lab reports are easy, and you should score 100% for both. they're a lot of fun to do, and you should prepare for them beforehand. exams are not particularly difficult or unfair, but they are hard to score well for, because there are almost never any method marks, so an incorrect solution to a previous part of a question can derail an entire question. exams have fairly generous time limits, so take your time to check your answers. no calculators were allowed for the mid-terms, and only one handwritten (yes, must be written by hand) single-sided help sheet was allowed. scientific calculators were permitted for the finals, as was one double-sided help sheet.the only negatives of this module is that some of the module content feels a little too tightly focused. i'd rather the module was more about concepts than content. also, mips is not a particularly prevalent cpu architecture, and while it may be more useful pedagogically, it feels that learning about it has limited real life application.ps. i wrote a mips instruction encoder, which you may find useful for the

students and i suggest only taking this as an elective if you are intending to minor in computer science or computer engineering.there are two distinct halves of this module, which are separated by recess week. before recess week, we learn about logic circuits which includes binary arithmetic (and other bases as well), hamming codes, logic and logic gates, logic function expressions, karnaugh maps, msi components, combinational circuits and sequential circuits. very interesting and it is quite important for labs when you are designing your own logic circuits.the second half goes more on the software side, albeit a much much lower level, clsoer to the hardware implementation. here we learn a language which is at a lower level than c, which is assembly. we used the mips architecture in this case, and other topics include performance, instruction set architecture, datapaths, control flow, pipelining (very important) and lastly ending off with learning about the cache.lecturer: aaron tanthis was the first time aaron tan was taking the module alone. usually he would teach the first part, involving logic circuits and then dr. soo would come in after the mid-sem break to teach the second part of the module. the content was always quite heavy in the module so a lot of reading, understanding and memorizing will be involved (memorization will be much less if you have a good cheat sheet :)) the lectures are generally well paced and aaron likes to hold interesting demonstrations using the students to illustrate concepts more clearly. (pay attention to these demonstrations, these demos may be bonus questions!) there are also practice questions which we are meant to do on the spot, and some other which he likes to call ""3 second quizzes"". again, as i mentioned in another module aaron tan teaches, be sure to take down notes because aaron's slides always leave blanks meant for students to fill on their own. however, these lectures are webcasted so it is not that bad if you missed something. just watch the webcast to catch it again.the lectures are 3 hours per week, with one two hour slot and another one hour slot. generally they are well paced even though sometimes aaron squeezes too much into the friday lecture (and too little into the monday ones). recommended you attend so you can bug him with your numerous questions.continual assessment breakdown:5% tutorial attendancetutor: zhou juntutorials are held weekly with one hour slot. the tutorials are generally quite easy to do, with maybe one or two tricky questions. it is split into two parts. the first part, is meant for discussion on the forums and the rest will be gone through during class. zhou jun is very efficient in covering our tutorials and he expects people to come out write the solutions and asks the class to crtique answers accordingly.it is recommended you attend tutorials for two reasons:1) there are marks allocated for tutorial attendance 2) tutorial solutions which are uploaded are often incomplete. you will only get the full solutions by copying down whatever your tutor goes through during class!15% labslab ta: guo zi hethis is probably the best part of this module. as a physics loving guy, i love to play around with circuits , and making our own logic circuits in this module was a fantastic experience. during the second half of the module, we created circuits using a software called logism, and we also played around with basic assembly programming (seriously quite fun, although you write lines and lines of code). you are advised to do as much of the lab as possible (designing circuits, testing out programs) at home and then do the execution during your lab period. this way you are more than likely to finish your labs on time, and in most cases very early, giving you more free time to catch up on whatever you like. do take note though, don't be careless, as i found out to my cost. it pays to be careful and to bring up your ca mark as much as possible here 10% assignmentswe had a total of three assignments (supposed to be 4 but aaron decided there was no time for the fourth one). the assignments are generally manageable, so yet again do check your answers thoroughly and discuss with friends before handing them in, and try to get close to full marks as possible (it is definitely doable). you normally have about a week to do each assignment, so try and finish as quickly possible.20% mid termsmid-terms were generally ok. a 1 page hand-written cheat sheet is allowed. use it wisely to write down things you normally would need to memorize (e.g. truth tables for various functions, excitation tables for flip flops etc.). the more you squeeze in, the less you need to memorize and are able to focus on the concepts which are key to doing well in this module. do organize your information well as time is of the essence. only downside is no calculators (if i remember correctly). do score highly as well (my batch's mean was about 30 out of maximum of 40 marks). do watch out for the bonus question too :)50%  finalslike the mid-terms, the finals were generally manageable with a few tricky bits here and there. your cheat sheet becomes even more important here especially for assembly language functions, datapath diagrams and pipelining. at this point i would like to reiterate that you should not copy paste your  entire lecture notes into the cheat sheet (you only have one page (both sides) which you are allowed to bring in). put stuff that will make you rely less on memory and more on application of concepts. it greatly aids your studying and will be handy reference in your examinations. calculators are allowed for finals. i only had one regret after the paper of not drawing my own datapath diagram on my cheat sheet despite the ample space avaialbletldr; this module's content is generally easy (given you put in effort), with the exception of pipelining. that stuff, though important to computer science, is bloody confusing and irritating even till now. get as many marks as you can in your ca components and examinations and such consistent performance should guarantee you an a. and most importatntly, prepare your cheat sheet smartly.expected grade: afinal grade: asee more 00 replyshare ›show more replies"

agotaken in ay 20/21 sem 2 tutor: noelle catherine wee sok huitwin mod paired with cs 2113 t. there were 2 oral presentations and a few other written assignments along the way.since others have already mentioned what this module entails, i would like to point out some flaws i see in this module and hope that it can be improved for future batches. my personal take on celc modules or any module that has celc embedded in them, is that these ""communication"" modules does the opposite of teaching stem students to be better presenters and speakers.firstly, they have very strict rules and targets that they want students to meet in presentations or reflections. every assignment is just a case of ticking the checkboxes, despite being a more ""artsy"" module. even though such presentations would be considered trash, people who managed to tick the checkboxes would get good grades. for example, students are rewarded for speaking at a constant pace, where to me personally, it sounds monotonous and in the context of pitching a product or making a demonstration, would not be ideal. communication skills in this module is often taken out of context and such ""skills"" and ""knowledge"" applied in the module is not actually transferable to real life presentations.secondly, professors do not standardize the kind of grades they give their students across classes. in my experience, my class generally had much lower raw scores as compared to other classes when i asked around. however, we are most likely still placed on the same bell-curve, which puts our class at a disadvantage. additionally, despite claims that they try to standardize across different classes, the grading still feels opaque, but i'm in no position to question their grading and effort put into grading.(this is my personal experience and by no means representative of the student who took this mod):since the professors do not have technical knowledge, dr noelle made assumptions about computing and stem students that are uncalled for. for example, things like computing students don't talk, where such things depends on context and mainly because computing mods do not have class participation marks that we need to fight for in class. hence, we are not used to speaking up as much in class, as compared to say business or fass students.secondly, dr noelle has an obvious preference over some of the students in class, and would tend to pick on students she do not like. hence, despite speaking up at every class and trying to pay attention in her class, she still questioned why i did not participate in class, which i am unable to confront her about since my grades were in her hands. another instance of such obvious bias is in feedback sessions for oral presentations, she would be discredit someone who tries to make hand gestures, but praise her favourites for not making any attempt at hand gestures since they are ""not comfortable with it"". well, i had assumed that a communications module is all about going out of your comfort zone but i guess not when such double standards exist.lastly, i still appreciate the existence of this module, as it had broaden my horizons, allowing me to see how academia is largely out of touch with the real world.this is not my first experience with a celc module/ celc embedded module, neither would it be my last. unfortunately, my experience haven't been the best with the kind of double standards and quality of the modules.see more 30 replyshare ›show more replies −+lll 6 years agotaken in ay 18/19 sem 2 tutor: chung shin ping, dianapaired module with cs 2103 t. both modules required us to form a group. previously, there were some requirements needed for each group (must have a female, foreigner, and be different from cs 2103 t group), but the requirements were dropped for the semester i took the module, and we could form any group we want. groups are strictly size 4-5.even before the module started, the cancer of finding groupmates started. instead of choosing groupmates randomly from tutorial groups, many people already pre-formed a group with their friends, and they would all bid for the same tutorial slot. this is very hard to coordinate due to timetable clashes, and this was aggravated by the late announcement of the cs 2103 t and cs 2101’s tutorial group pairings. eventually, i found a group of 5. the only common slot available for us was the 8 am slot, unfortunately. as no one likes to wake up at 8 am, the class size was quite small, having only 16 people. note that this number ""16"" is very special mathematically, that it doesn't allow groups of size 5, because 4*4=16. at the end, our group of 5 had to be split up into 2/3. so, i'd recommend pre-forming groups of size 4, and not 5.the first half of this module was about presentation and communication, while the second half was tied to cs 2103 t.i feel like this module is a waste of time. i spent most of my time at my 8 am class sleeping or doing my own work. in fact, my whole group ""prepares"" for this class by bringing in other work to do.they taught stuff like how to not offend people by saying ""this printer doesn't work this way"" over ""you shouldn't do this on the printer"", the difference being the word ""you"", because using the word “you” makes it sound like you are accusing the other party or something. to this day, i don't see the difference. they also taught us how to have a meeting, and that our meeting notes must be of exactly some format. in fact, one of the graded components in this module is to hold a fake team meeting, and we would be videoed and graded. i know a group who had a *practice team meeting*. like they met up and held a pre-team meeting to decide exactly what to say during the actual graded meeting.my tutor also wanted every group to wear matching formal attires during presentations. having 1 black shirts 3 white shirts in the group is unacceptable and would probably get some marks penalized. it should either all be same, or 2, 2.since the tutor didn't have technical knowledge on programming, for one of the group reports where we had to jot down problems we faced for the software engineering project, we made up some trash using some technical language. in exact words, we wrote: “the most significant problem encountered was the outage of service of our code collaboration platform from feb 25 to feb 28. we lost some files due to the downtime and had to reschedule some of our milestones. we took 2 days to reproduce the work that we have lost.”at least the workload for this module is quite low. there is very minimal homework, other than preparing for the presentation (there are only 2 presentations in total).final grade: b (s/u option exercised)see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+ffailing cs student 6 months agotaken in ay 24/25 semester 1 for assessment components, consult other reviews.workloadrelatively light. 3 h tutorial every week. some pre-tutorial preparation to be done (like videos to watch on canvas), and some presentations to prepare for.contentthere are videos to be watched every week that do cover topics like power of voice in presentations, rhetorical devices in pitches, writing of reader-centric user guides, and unessay formats (more on that later).assessmentsca 1: a pair presentation in week 6 about a communication topic. readings/references are provided and typically more than enough content for the presentation, although the quality did vary. communication topics aren’t all exactly about speaking/presenting/pitching, they can involve topics like responding well or active listening. there is a 10 minute individual rehearsal a week or two before the actual presentation, which i thought is a good structure since it does force each person to ensure they have more than sufficient content, and try certain strategies and obtain feedback about them, before condensing the content into just 4 minutes (and as mentioned by another review, that is a strict limit). there is also a q&a section, wherein each presenter is required to answer more than one question.my tutor was very strict when it came to marking of the presentations, with a decent number of my friends obtaining low 60%s in my class and other classes taught my the same tutor, and the class average seeming to be in the mid 60 s, while other classes’ tutors were supposedly a fair bit more lenient. in particular, my tutor seemed to penalise very heavily for not memorising scripts, or not having completely seamless delivery of their lines, which seems a bit unrealistic and rather demanding. additionally, the grading criterion also seemed rather cruel towards presenters who stalled, with a mandatory major deduction in marks. just like cs 2103 t, this seems to be a module designed to tear students down, not build them up.for some reason that is a little beyond me, the module coordinator seems to want peer feedback to feature strongly in ca 1 and ca 2, perhaps even more strongly than feedback from the tutor. i’m not too sure on the rationale for this, but at least my peers all did a good job with peer feedback.ca 2: a pitch in week 13 that seems to be somewhat disconnected from reality, made more difficult by my tutor. the aim is to pitch the significance of the idea for the cs 2103 t tp, which doesn’t seem too bad on first glance, but does get rather annoying. the requirement to create a pitch for a mixed audience, including both technical and non-technical individuals, while addressing various stakeholders, seems unclear. this confusion might arise from the ambiguous requirements in cs 2103 t. early tp decisions in cs 2103 t were guided by user stories, with less emphasis on the pitching requirements of cs 2101. my cs 2101 tutor did not highlight this during early decision-making stages. as a result, my cs 2103 t project prioritized user needs, with other stakeholders, such as managers, industry professionals, and investors, not really being soncidered. this approach lead to unpreparedness for potential criticisms and difficult questions during the pitch. creating a pitch for a diverse audience proved challenging, especially considering real-life examples shared by tutors often target only one or two specific groups. resultantly, the only way i found to engage an audience (just my tutor, honestly) was to make the whole pitch an unskippable 12-15 minute advertisement, rather than a product pitch you’d see in the real world.the same complaints about my tutor from cs 2101 apply here too, in addition to the additional annoyance i had of trying to do a peer evaluation properly only for the presenter i was evaluating to be interrupted by my tutor, while he was answering my tutor’s question.ca 3: this was the user guide that was prepared for cs 2103 t, just submitted again to cs 2101 and graded on things like readability and ease of use. not much to say here, other than to avoid making your user guide too cluttered, and perhaps to provide sufficiently specific setup guidance for the target users (who should be implied in the opening paragraph). additionally, it was slightly funny that ca 3’s rubric was poorly formatted, given that it was for an assessment on presentation and visuals.ca 4: an ‘unessay’ ‘reflection’ on what was learnt in the 12 weeks prior, submitted in week 12. it could take on any format other than an essay, which apparently also excludes opinion editorials, but not blogs, according to my tutor. in general, the idea of the ‘reflection’ needing to not be an essay and not be too close to an essay resulted in some negotiation with my tutor as to what could be considered one. the formats suggested by the rubric only added to the confusion, as certain formats like blog posts could well resemble essays just like an opinion editorial but were allowed. the variation in what was acceptable seemed a bit wide. some of the suggestions seemed to show a lack of understanding by whoever set the assessment of their formats/audience and perhaps a lack of understanding of media more generally, especially when one takes into account the other requirements, such as the task description and the guiding questions that had to be answered. these requirements included substantiating and providing sufficient evidence, which seemed to be difficult, if not downright contradictory to the format/nature of a comic or infographic, where one expects that there should be fewer words than in a blog post. furthermore, the effort to have a presentable submission varied rather greatly between the different formats, with videos and skits for instance requiring much more effort to storyboard, script, act, film and edit than a simple podcast or blog post.the guiding questions and rubric were also rather long, and i do wonder whether it’s even possible for a single submission to meet all the guiding points and tick all boxes in the rubric while staying within the word/time limit, even in the most essay-like of formats or fastest presentation possible in video form. finally, the demand of defining audience, context and other information (purpose?) seems somewhat strange, since if it’s supposed to be a personal reflection/sharing, then why would one be choosing a medium/form of media that has a natural audience/context that goes far beyond that?closing thoughtsif you dislike talking, presenting or hated those parts of is 1108 or es 2660, you won’t enjoy this module. in my view, the biggest takeaways from this module were that my tutor, as strict as he is, did appreciate the slides i put a good amount of effort into, and the realisation for myself that pitching isn’t necessarily as hard as i sometimes imagine it to be. other than that, cs 2101 doesn’t seem to teach all that much about communication, isn’t particularly theoretical, and generally is a bit hard to characterise (or maybe, it’s just a time filler because cs 2103 t definitely isn’t 4 units, but also isn’t quite 8 units).see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+kkinggobslayera year agoterm: ay 23/24 s 2 with all due

replies −+disqus_8 tyboosixya year agoeditedtaken in ay 23/24 sem 1 tutor: lee jun hiangmy experience with cs 2101, paired with the otherwise delightful cs 2103 t, was an absolute disappointment. the promise of a presentation-focused module turned into a suffocating, creativity-crushing nightmare.the fundamental flaw lies in the rigid rubrics that confine students to a single, uninspired framework—the scqa (situation, complication, question, answer). any deviation, any attempt at injecting personality or originality into presentations, was met with severe penalties.whether it was the tutor or the inherent design of the module, the message was clear: conform or suffer. expressing creativity or delivering engaging presentations wasn’t just discouraged, it was punished. heaven forbid you tried to lighten the mood with a joke or present information in a slightly informal manner—your grades would plummet.the class became a parade of robotic presentations, each following the same monotonous structure. it was as if we were all npcs, stripped of individuality and creativity, regurgitating information without any spark or personal touch.the worst part? the module sucked the joy out of learning and presenting. instead of fostering creative thinking and expression, it forced students into a suffocating box of uniformity. presentations were no longer about sharing ideas but about conforming to a soul-crushing template.sure, my expected grade was close to what i received—an a- instead of an a—but at what cost? the educational value was overshadowed by the stifling environment that discouraged originality and creativity at every turn.cs 2101 may claim to teach presentation skills, but in reality, it's an exercise in conformity, robbing students of the opportunity to explore diverse presentation styles and engage authentically with their audience. absolutely disgusting, and whoever designed this mod has definitely not done a proper presentation outside of academia before.on another note, the ta exhibits blatant favouritism too, giving significantly higher grades to students whom she favours. on top of that, the q&as are also made a lot easier for students whom she favours. she would often grill those she disliked, presenting them with very challenging questions and even disagreeing with their answers with no backings to her claims (like if you answered by saying that this was a result from a study, she would scoff at you and said ""really meh?""), while she would barely even raise questions for the students whom she favoured, since q&a answers are also part of your grade, this can raise or plummet your grades further. if you do get this ta, just make sure that you land on her good sidesee more 10 replyshare ›show more

components:team meeting reflections: 10%oral presentation 1: 20%oral presentation 2: 20%user guide: 20%critical reflection: 15%class participation: 15%comments:i noticed that there hasn't been a review for cs 2101 in a while, so i thought i would write one to shed some light on the current iteration of the module. as nus cs students, we are required to take two modules under celc, namely es 2660 and this module cs 2101. having taken es 2660 last semester and cs 2101 this semester, i would say that both modules have their similarities, e.g. both have two 2-hour tutorial slots a week, and both have presentation/speaking components, but ultimately, i feel that they are quite fundamentally different in terms of what they teach.i will not go too in depth but es 2660 focused on developing our critical thinking abilities, learning frameworks to analyse texts, learning how to provide insightful contributions during a panel discussion and even how to craft up a coherent impromptu speech. whereas in cs 2101, we learn how to better communicate (literally). we learn the verbal/non-verbal cues of a presentation, how to resolve conflicts in a group setting, and even how to criticise someone (tactfully).to set some context, tutorials are held in a 20-student physical classroom setting, and there was alot of group discussion and class participation. i had a fantastic tutor that facilitated alot of bantering and chatting within the classroom, and i really enjoyed these interactions alot. honestly speaking, cs 2101 is one of the most fun modules i have taken in nus so far. this is because unlike most other tutorials that i have taken, where the tutor would just be giving a monologue of technical information (cs students can relate), cs 2101's classroom setting really was quite chill and the interactions really reminded me of my secondary school / jc classroom days, where everyone knew each other and there was alot of genuine interactions.for those that are taking this module in the future, please do take it with an open mind! it really is quite a fun module. at the very least, it will be a refreshing break from your heavier workload/content modules. and if you choose to make the most out of it, i really think you can learn some interesting stuff and meet some amazing people!tldr 1 is worst, 5 is bestenjoyment: 5/5 workload: 2/5 difficulty: 2/5 usefulness:

grade so differently until the average for an assignment for a class can be 10 marks apart. you must attend them as much as possible since participation marks are awarded, which also means a lot of bs-ing in class.this is a purely ca module, so no exams whatsoever. however, there are a lot of graded tasks. there are 2 oral presentations, so you need to learn how to do confident public speaking and be prepared to have a script and slides at hand. the first op is harder due to the random topic, but the second one is easier since it touches the cs domain where you have better understanding of it. however, since the second is technically software demo, there is conflict between cs 2103 t and cs 2101 due to the different requirements between them. there is also a group oral discussion that is pretty much just trying to talk about some random topic within a group, a bit like having an educational conversation within a group. this is quite fun since no preparations are needed and its not

this mod.the pros are that firstly, the product pitch and demo helps to prepare you for hackathons and actual product pitches (in an extremely limited capacity, but it still does). this also comes in handy when presenting new features/ideas as a member of a software development team. another pro is that in some way, it does encourage students to develop their communication skills through presentations and class participation.the cons are that the rest of the content in this mod lack substance and are barely useful in your working life. i did enjoy preparing for ca 1 because i like to

repeat fun. after enduring es 2660, you may be wondering whether this compulsory communications module is as boring as that. i beg to differ, so before you decide to burn your precious su on this module, hear me out. this review will mainly cover ca 1 and ca 2. the rest of the components are written assignments and class participation.ca 1 oral presentation 20%this is the first major assessment of this module in which we are allocated in groups of 3. we got to choose a communication topic from the list and created a 9-minute presentation. this was the first time i had to memorise and rehearse for a presentation. balancing both audience engagement and recalling my lines was extremely tough and made me nervous. the good thing about this module was that there were practice presentations where we received amazing feedback to better ourselves for the actual presentation. before the actual presentation, i was breaking out in a cold sweat with my hands shaking. the presentation went well in my perspective but there were things i needed to improve on. my voice projection and engaging tones were my strength, but my pacing was a major issue. my rapid speech made it difficult for the audience to follow along. ca 1 was a defining moment in this module. applying the persuasive techniques taught and conducting a presentation where not only content is graded was a first for me. the skills and feedback received here would help in the next component of this module.ca 2 oral presentation 20%this presentation is on creating a product pitch for the application that was implemented from cs 2103 t. the application would help hiring managers keep track of applicants. we had to create a convincing and enticing pitch to get investors and users to use our product. this presentation was much harder compared to ca 1. we had to decide on how to incorporate some rhetoric devices as well as incorporating a live demonstration of the application. i experienced similar emotions of nervousness and anxiousness. my part was intertwined with another teammate in which he would do a live demonstration of the application. this was nerve-wracking as ensuring both his and my parts go smoothly was a challenge. i was able to demonstrate more confidence and better articulation during this round of presentation. however, some feedback that i received was a specific use of the filler “uh like”. i also had a slight recurrence of the same problem of pacing.being able to engage with the audience as well as good team dynamics is crucial in becoming a successful software professional. these skills will be essential in conveying ideas and leading projects successfully. continuous improvement in this communication journey is required by practicing in speech pacing as

20%at the start, i was kind of skeptical about what i could gain from a supposed “fluff” module. however, after completing the course, i do think that it provided me with some useful soft skills that would be useful to many of us cs students. so read on if you want to learn more. this review will mainly cover on my ca 1 and ca 2 experiences.in ca 1, groups of 3 students were assigned a communication topic (mine was on emotional intelligence) and tasked with demonstrating its value and practical application to your peers (3 min speech + q&a). to be honest, i did not really enjoy presenting on a topic that i wasn’t passionate about. but through this experience, you sort of learn how to tailor any kinds of topic to your audience and presenting ideas clearly and persuasively. my advice for ca 1? start preparing early, practice extensively, and focus on delivering your content naturally. don't rely too heavily on scripts, as they can hinder your ability to connect with your audience. trust me, the more you practice, the more confident and natural your delivery will become.ca 2 felt a lot more meaningful to me, since students get to present on their cs 2103 t product through a product demonstration and pitch to your specific product target audience. personally, this assessment helped to refine my communication skills by compelling me to showcase the technical aspects of my project while effectively communicating its value and potential impact to a non-technical crowd. to excel in ca 2, invest time in crafting a compelling narrative and use visuals to support your message. practice your delivery to ensure a smooth and confident presentation. i found that incorporating personal anecdotes and examples helped me connect with my audience and make my presentation more engaging.throughout the module, i discovered the power of nonverbal communication, a feedback i have often received from my tutor. eye contact, gestures, and vocal variety can significantly impact how your message is received. however, i must emphasize that you need strike a balance and not overdo it, as sometimes i feel that students can come across as forced or unnatural when they overcompensate.take this module with an open mind. it’s important to note that developing communication skills is an ongoing process. don't expect to become a master communicator overnight. it takes practice, self-reflection, and a willingness to take in feedback. embrace the presentations (if you dread them it’s only going to be worse), be open to feedback from both your tutor and your peers, and don't be afraid to experiment with different communication styles. with dedication and practice, you'll be surprised at how much you can grow and improve throughout the semester!expected

modules, but it still pulls its weight in adding workload at the wrong timing. workload comes in spurts due to the ca components deadlines. expect high workload when oral presentation comes around since you are expected to memorise your script (or you know, don't, if you are god given at public speaking).usefulness: 5/10 theoretically useful for internship, but let's face it, your character is not going to change drastically just because you learnt how to act in a workplace. if anything, this module teaches you how to put on a fake front, which i guess is useful to be socially accepted in your workplace. however, i will agree some parts are useful, such as improving on oral presentations and perhaps internship interviews.experience: 8/10 experience may vary, but depending on how chill your classmates are, it can be fun. i took the mod with a bunch of my friends, and it was enjoyable. the tutor is experienced with the workforce and human relations, although not very into tech.

with cs 2103 t, where you will learn to work with other people and communicate well as a software person. the first half of the module focused on working professionally, such as writing resumes, cover letters and communicating with those of other cultures, and the second half talked about writing documentation for software. i really could not be bothered to do too much for this module, since the content was not very intellectually stimulating, but i did learn a few things about how things were in professional settings. that said, much more of the learning would take place during internships and work placements.lessons were two hour a week affairs, twice a week, constituting much of the workload. though it may be tiring to attend so many lessons in person, group discussions made it feel less like mental torture. my tutor was also highly professional and got the attention of the class most of the time, and some of my classmates also lightened the mood. very interestingly, quite a number of students in my class skipped tutorial sessions chronically, but it appears that no one has ever failed the module, so those going for an s/u can do virtually anything and pass the class.each graded presentation, the first on working effectively in the office, and the second on demonstrating or pitching a software product, was supposed to take up the entire length of a class session, so that many questions could be raised after the presentation. during this discussion, my tutor also raised some important points about job hunting or other important things. presenting your work to others effectively is an important skill, and i do think the teaching team helped with improving your skill, yet i do wonder how much the average student improved their presenting skills by.the workload for this module is not very high, unless your group wants to put a lot of effort into presentations. from what i have seen, a fair number of students would like to be done with their presentations and do something else instead. as a computer science, information security or computer engineering student, you will have to do this module, and those of all other majors would have to do something similar.[click on my profile to check out my module review blog]see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+emily lim 5 years agotaken in ay 19/20 sem 2 tutor: dr janepaired module with

ay 18/19 sem 1.  tutored by ms diana chung; module coordinated by ms anita toh.this module is taken by computer science students together with cs 2103 t to fulfil soc requirements.  it is coordinated and run by staff from the centre for english language communication (celc).  the first half of the semester teaches general communication and workplace interaction skills, while the second half of the semester is heavily linked to the software engineering project from cs 2103 t (such as writing user/developer guides and making presentations for the cs 2103 t project).the module is conducted in a similar style to es 2660 - contact time is via sectional groups of 20 students each, and class participation is expected.  the 20 students in each sectional group will be in the same cs 2103 t tutorial.  there are no midterms or finals, and the s/u option can be exercised on this module.students need to form two sets of groups in this module: in the first half of the semester (for work and assessment not directly related to cs 2103 t), and in the second half of the semester (this will be the grouping for the cs 2103 t software engineering project).  when i took the module, each group was required to contain at least one male, one female, one singaporean, and one non-singaporean student, and no more than two people in the same group for the first half of the semester were allowed to share a group for the second half.  generally, students optimise for their cs 2103 t group (i.e. the second half of the semester) as it would have an impact on their cs 2103 t grade.at the end of the semester, students are required to produce a project portfolio page (ppp) that summarises their contributions to the cs 2103 t project.  this ppp is an extract of relevant sections from the user and developer guides of the cs 2103 t project, and is graded by both cs 2103 t and cs 2101, but to different requirements.  as the length of the ppp is limited to ten pages, there is some contention as to which module's requirements the limited ppp real estate should be allocated to.  since the s/u option can be used for cs 2101 but not cs 2103 t, the choice is clear for many.there are at least three in-class presentations (on content of a non-technical nature) for this module, and some amount of preparation work is required for each of them.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies

will be for the teaching of the skills and practicing them on the spot so don’t expect to be able to skip them.here is the syllabus:communication skillsapplying communication principles to assignments and in-class discussions (communication process, barriers to communication, listening skills, audience analysis, channels of communication and 7 cs of effective communication)functioning in a team

guide, integration of text and graphics, editing for completeness and language accuracy)writing critical reflections and responses on issues raised in discussions and project meetingsthis module is graded this way:2 oral presentations (peer teaching and software demo): 30%group oral discussion: 15%project portfolio (containing user and developer guides): 15%reflections: 25%class participation and oral interactions: 15%although attendance for cs 2101 is compulsory, i still enjoyed it. that’s mostly you are required to discuss the topics with our classmates and much of the content is quite intuitive or even self-explanatory. also, because of the ca grading, there are no finals of this module.other than the slightly higher workload during the semester the only complaint that i have would be the conflicting requirements between the project scope from cs 2101 and cs 2103 for the software demo. cs 2103 encourages us to narrow our target audience and have our product target them but cs 2101 wants us to target all audiences. problem is that after 4 weeks of work put into the product, it was unnatural and difficult to demo the already specialised product (addressbook and data analytics for teachers) for a general audience (people from diverse backgrounds at the nus roadshows). maybe there is a lesson that i’m not learning here, but it seems to me that the two modules might have conflicting ideas on what we should do for the software.overall, i’m quite disappointed at my b grade which i really don’t know why i deserved. if they could break down the scores and give a reason for that, that would be great. you might want to save an su for this one.bell curve rating: i have no sensing on this onehelpful resources:none neededmodule rating: mostly quite chill except

usp). in this case, this module is used to equip students with necessary non-technical skills that will help in promoting the product they are trying (or have built). this module is run in conjunction with cs 2103 t (which i believe will be replaced with cs 2113 t for batches after 16/17), where all the documentation and presentations are in relation to the product the team is building in cs 2103 t.the module covers various aspects necessary non-technical aspects in software development, such as establishing a proper work ethic, learning how to work well as a team, and various communication aspects such as producing a user and developer guides, doing a product demonstration and reflecting critically on the entire process. it also teaches how to write proper formal communications such as emails and progress reports. needless to say, a lot of writing and speaking is involved in this module so it is best to be prepared for that.i must emphasize that you ""can"" choose your groups for this module. it is put in quotes because it depends on the tutor and also on the fact whether all 4 members of your preferred group are able to get the same timeslot for this class. note that the timeslots for cs 2101 must be matched to the corresponding timeslot for 2103 t, which results in much cursing and swearing when planning one's timetable. normally, the composition of an ideal group is that it must have at least one girl and one foreigner. all of this depends on the composition of the class itself, so be prepared to work with someone whom you are not familiar with. in this aspect, i was lucky enough to have a group i was quite familiar with, so i did not face much problems in that aspect.due to the concurrent running of the modules (this and cs 2103 t), there were of course certain problems that came with it. examples include writing a progress report where we had barely started on our projects and some clash in presentation of our user and developer guides (it almost went to the stage when it felt like we needed to produce 2 copies of each , one set for each module, which of course made us very angry). i sincerely hope that our feedback last semester has really had some effect and these concurrency issues are fixed.tutor: ms isabel chewms chew is a great tutor. she keeps the content to the essentials without skimping over the necessary details such that there is ample time for class discussions or group discussions on particular topics. she is always ready to give relevant pointers during our discussions and is always ready to take questions from groups on certain unclear requirements for the portfolio. personally, i enjoyed her lessons very much and i did learn quite a bit from them. she is quite strict on her assessments though, so be sure to always produced your very best work.assessment:oral presentations (two presentations, 15% each)there are two assessed presentations throughout the entire semester (with some other informal ones in between). the first one serves as a ""seminar-style"" presentation, where your group plays the lecturer on that occasion, telling the class about the topic to be discussed for that week. these include:1) effective listening,2) intercultural communication,3) conflict resolution and negotiation and 4) interview skills.normally each group presents one of these topics (normally 4 groups in a class). there are guiding questions provided, but ultimately the content focus is up to your group to decide. be ready to justify your decisions of your focus in the content so on and so forth.the second presentation, is where you will demonstrate the product you have built for cs 2103 t (i.e. the todo list, for more details, read the 2103 t reviews). you will be given a scenario on where you are doing your demonstration and it pays to have the demonstration be eye-catching as possible (especially to the normal layperson on the street.). so the presentation for this will differ for the 2103 t case, so do as much as possible to make your presentation stand out.for both presentations, you are expected to at least be in smart casual (if not formal), and of course you are expected to be creative and cohesive in your presentations. you can co-ordinate all of this with your group members however you wish to. in addition, there are strict time limits to be adhered to, so it is best to ensure you rehearse your presentations with timing to ensure you don't go overboard and you can streamline your content if required. there will be a q&a segment at the end as well, so you would do well to spot some questions. it is best if your group members all take on the questions in equal measure, so do not hog your questions during q&a (unless you want to risk being marked down big time during peer evaluation).in addition, you will be doing self-evaluations and peer evaluations during presentations as well (i.e. you will be assessing other groups). it pays to provide as much constructive criticism as possible because after all, this is for the betterment of everyone. so make sure you do pay attention to other's people's presentation. a self-evaluation after each presentation is required to be submitted as well. all of these factor into your grades for both presentation and class participation. do note that whatever you provide critique on, people will be looking for those things when you present. so be sure to, as much as possible, not repeat mistakes that were previously made.critical reflections (1 st : 10% , 2 nd: 15%):there are two reflections to be submitted. one is to be submitted online, in the form of a blog post while the other will be done in class. the reflections in both cases have a similar content. they will ask you to reflect on your current experience with your team members and what you have learnt about them and yourself so far. there will be guiding questions involved so there is no need to worry if you feel lost about what to write. for the first reflection, you are required to write responses as well to another person's reflection (comments/observations etc.), within a week of it being posted online (using nus blogs). this is the main reason why you are encouraged to write reflections of substantial length so that the person writing the response at least has something to write about.the second reflection is to be done in class fully, therefore the higher weightage. much of the same content is required, but it is of course made harder under the timed environment. make sure you plan out your points properly, and do not be afraid if you end up finishing slightly earlier than expected (by slightly i mean 20-30 minutes before the end, not 1 hour before the end).  it also does pay to plan out everything properly, as it will lead to a higher chance of the reflection written neater, and hence you will have an easier time doing your word count. there is a soft limit on how much too write so try to hit that benchmark as closely as possible. it does not pay to be concise, neither does it pay for you to ramble on some argument .user guide and developer guide (15%)the user and developer guides are deliverables that relate to the app that you build. the user guide of course acts as a tool to tell the user how to navigate the various features of the app, while the developer guide is used to tell people who wish to build off your app (i.e. people like yourselves), the basic architecture of the app as well as how to contribute and build upon your group's work.it is obvious that the developer guide is technical so cs 2101 will not focus too much on the content of the developer guide, but more on its structure and organisation. the user guide is the one that will come under greater focus. it is important to note that in cs 2101, the presentation of your materials is very important, especially for the user guide. being easy to read and understand is critical in ensuring that the user gets the best experience out of using the app, and that is exactly what graders will be looking for.class participation (15%)this needs little explanation. like most language modules, class participation forms a substantial portion of one's grade. therefore, it is important to not be the silent witness in class, but actively participate in discussions and offer your own points of view/perspectives where required. that being said, don't be a wayang king. letting other people have a say and listening to them is an important communication skill as well. and therefore it too pays a role in good class participation.oral discussion (15%)this is the last assessed component, which basically aims to assess how you play to assist team dynamics. in this particular assessment, you will be put together with 3 other people from other groups, such that each of you is from a different group in the class. following that, you will be given a situation, upon which you need to hold a group meeting/discussion. there is a short period of preparation time and then 15 minutes for the meeting (this is timed so it pays to do proper preparation during the alloted time). again, hogging the limelight and trying to speak as much as possible will again eventually lead to you being penalized for not being an effective listener, which is part of being an effective communicator.tl;dr : a module with a lot of writing and speaking, and it is a necessary skill one will need as a software engineer. hence this module should not be taken lightly. assessments are well spread out, so do your best in each and every one of them. concurrency issues may occur, but hopefully they are ironed out. for those who have an admiring cap to keep, you might want to save an s/u for this module.expected

i'd walk away with the idea that oop is the one true paradigm, because (a) all the tools and environments are already setup to be oop-friendly and everything-else-adverse; (b) the module, the professor, the tutors, they all keep endorsing oop, whether implicitly or explicitly; (c) the starting code given (for the tp) is written in oop, and is even said to be ""well-written""; (d) all my friends are writing oop code. i'd graduate with a warped view of programming, with the idea that large software projects invariably end up being oop. in fact, given the structure of the nus compsci curriculum, all you'd graduate with is ""oop"", and ""java streams"" (thanks prof henry). tragic.this module completely does not cover any other kinds of programming paradigms. from day 0 and the individual project, it's all objects, classes, oop oop oop. one of the deliverables for the individual project (henceforth ip) was literally ""more oop -- implement more oop"". this gets worse for the team project (tp). as you might have read from the other, less scathing reviews here, it is a brownfield project, so you start with some existing code. and let me tell you, damn is that field brown. it's not dirt, by the way. let's just say it's... fertiliser.the code you will be given is your typical, enterprise java oop garbage codebase. full of classes pointlessly abstracted out, code that is a sort of ""implicit spaghetti"", and classes that literally have no state (only methods), and yet are instantiated -- all for a program that doesn't do very much. about that spaghetti -- because of ""abstraction"" and the ""single level of abstraction principle"" (abbreviated slap, how fitting), the code *looks* neat, but you'll soon realise that in order to actually grasp the program (addressbook 3 -- ab 3 (https://github.com/se-edu/a..., you end up jumping all over the place. it's bad.in short, this mod pretends to be software engineering, but in reality it is oop engineering. so if i don't write oop code, am i not a software engineer? do i not qualify for the $5 k median starting pay of cs graduates?(2) sponsored by the uml mafia-------------------------------------you better get used to uml, because so much of the finals will be testing uml. guess what -- after this module, i couldn't tell you what the notation for interfaces are any more. does it matter? no. just like the mips mafia (which you will be familiar with if you took/take cs 2100), the uml mafia is another shadowy organisation that somehow manages to get schools all over the world to push uml and treat it like it's the holy grail of program structure/organisation representation. (hint: it's not).here's my personal take:1. for a high level overview, nobody needs such a rigorous, over-specified notation like uml. does it matter what specific methods this specific class has? no -- that's what your ide is for. in fact, the 2103 textbook even states that there isn't a standardised notation for architecture diagrams in uml. god bless.2. for a low level detail, nothing beats reading well-documented code. here's the problem with uml: it's not code. having outdated documentation is already a massive, known problem in the software industry. if programmers can forget (and/or be lazy) to update documentation that's literally right next to the code they're changing (eg. doxygen, javadocs), do you think they'll update a bunch of silly uml diagrams that need to be compiled to silly pictures by a silly tool? probably not. uml will get outdated so much faster than documentation, that the one true source of information is the program source code itself.i won't get into too much detail for the rest of the mod, as the other reviews cover it pretty well. the other thing i want to say is that the mode of assessment frankly sucks. as you might gather, there's 3 main components: the ip, the tp, and the final exam. (i think there might be class participation -- would explain why the tutor keeps name-calling us).here's the thing: literally 90% or more of the class will get full marks for the ip. yes, full marks. as long as you submit a working program that meets the specification (which isn't very hard), there's literally no way you can get below full marks. there's a component where you need to add a gui with javafx, but guess what? there's literally a tutorial that you can copy-and-paste code from, and there you go. all you need to do is change a few pictures and you're done. guess why 80% of the submissions for the ip literally look like reskins of each other?the ip component had weightage of ~20%. what does that mean? it means that it's literally worthless. unless you're a good student, there's no need to put in so much effort into your ip -- just the minimum will get you that 20%. (putting in extra effort, eg. differentiating your program from the rest, probably won't get you any bonuses either).next is the tp, which is ~45% (?) of the grade (more than the final exam). again, given that this was a brownfield project with an existing codebase, from what i could tell, there were 2 kinds of groups -- the kind that basically came up with an entirely new program, and the kind that didn't really change the existing code too much. there was hardly any middle ground, from what i could tell. where does that leave you? it means that even if your team really puts in a lot of effort to make a good submission, there's tens of other teams that are submitting comparable projects. and that means that this bunch will get mostly full marks for the tp component as well.finally, the final exam. so, after getting full marks for the ip, and full or close to full marks for the tp (because you're a good student who put in a lot of effort, and had a good team to carry you, right?), you're still fighting for that a+ with lots of other people on this end of the bell curve. remember how i said you had better dissolve uml paper in water and drink it? in the end, your grade might be determined mostly by the final exam and it's mere ~30% weightage. so what does the final consist of? uml. yes, uml. sure, there's other components like code style, conceptual questions on testing and other stuff, but... uml. seriously, go memorise your uml (or get a good cheatsheet).there's graded components for documentation as well -- on the cs 2103 side, the developer guide. because this isn't 2101, it doesn't need to be *that* polished -- just make sure your uml is correct, and it doesn't look too shabby. it's probably a good idea to designate one person in your team to be in charge of formatting and error-checking, and another to be in charge of polishing the uml.finally, there's the bug-testing part of the assessment, which was... an interesting concept. (not a bad one, mind you). there's 3 parts -- (1) attack other people's tp to find bugs; (2) attack other people's tp documentation to find errors; (3) defend your own tp against attacks by refuting their bogus claims.the problem is that sometimes you might get a group that either (a) is simply too good that there's very few ""high-severity"" bugs, or (b) the group simply didn't add that much functionality that there are very few new bugs at all. (bugs from ab 3 don't count). when other people file bugs against your project, your team does get to give a rebuttal (including downgrading severity, rejecting it, etc. -- with appropriate justification), and you can counter-rebut a team's justification against your bug reports. the teaching team uses some magical orb of wisdom to decide who wins, and it's not very transparent here. sometimes you get truly stubborn people who insist that your program should work the way they want it, and not the way that you have clearly documented in your user guide. for some reason.of course it's not all bad things; you do learn how to use git+github with a forking workflow, intellij idea (personally i didn't use that piece of bloatware), and how to write tests with junit. the textbook also does *skim through* some code quality fundamentals (like the slap thingy, as well as basic solid stuff from 2030), but not to a great degree. it's not *all* useless.team wise, as others have said, it's better to get together with people you know beforehand, and try to get into the same tutorial group. you get to choose (with caveats), so choose wisely. there's some restrictions that remind me of hdb racial quotas -- can't be all the same gender, needs at least one non-singaporean, etc. -- so either have that token group member already part of your decided group, or form a group of 3-4 people and literally cold call the remaining people (that's what we did -- zoom chat and email ""yo you wanna join us"") to fill up the 5 people. and don't just pick people you know -- make sure they're competent too. if you end up with a bunch of people who are lackadaisical, the project won't turn out well.tl;dr: uml. it's compulsory, you can't escape this. uml. get good teammates. uml. it's not that hard in a practical sense, but the final exam is important. uml.this review was not sponsored by the uml mafia.see more 21 replyshare ›show more replies −+ssurvivingcsa year agoeditedthis is by far the ""least enjoyable"" module i have taken at nus so far.before i type in my review, i would like to first clarify that:1. i love my team and i am really grateful to have teamed up with them.2. prof damith is a very good lecturer that cares about students. he was with us answering questions over the weekends during pe dry run and the actual pe.3. my review is solely on the structure and design of the course, not on any individuals from the teaching team.what went wrong?1. diversity quota: every team must adhere to the diversity guidelines, and factors like gender, race, nationality, etc. will be taken into consideration. this means that minorities like international students or girls do not have a choice to pick their group and will be thrown around by other teams, which sort of sucks because nationality and gender is something that you are born with.2. practical exam: in case you don't know, cs 2103 t pe is when each team will review a project from another team, and report bugs that occur. this resulted in a zero-sum situation where: 1. teams will be desperate to find the bugs of another team that it induces anxiety, and 2. in some cases, the team member who contributed more on the project will more likely produce some bugs unintentionally, and the teammatescan assign the bug reports to themand they will be the only person to tank the mark (otherwise deductions will be split equally among team members). this resulted in some people unwilling to contribute much knowing that it may hurt them in the long run, and i know a couple of teams that have this exact mentality. you see, the pe does not just only create a zero-sum situation among the teams, it also creates a zero-sum situation among the team members within a team!combining the above, this resulted in a few scenarios:1. an international full-time undergraduate got assigned to a group of (existing) friends because theycannot pick their own team for being the minority in the class, ended up doing most of the work, and still got negative peer reviews. i'm not sure if they did well in the finals, but i heard that they ended up getting a b.2. another international full-time undergraduate got assigned to a group of (existing) friends (again) for the same reason. the team agreed to assign bug reports equally. however, toward the very end of pe, the person got more bug reports than they deserved and (again, not sure how they did in finals) ended up getting another low grade.final thoughtsdespite being an international and minority in my class, i am grateful to be assigned to a team of understanding people that are supportive, kind and chill. we ended up working on the project together and solved each others' problems selflessly, not pointing fingers when receiving bug reports and came up with plans together to produce strong counterarguments to those reports. i am really, really grateful to have known them and i really love my team.unfortunately, this is not the case for everyone, although i truly wish everyone in the class could have a similar experience to mine. however, due the rules thatinherently discourage collaboration, certain unfortunate situations may arise inevitably. as an educational institution, i do not think this is how things should be done and i wish things can change for the better. i know some people who would argue that ""but that's what happens when you start working in the industry!"" you may be right, but do you think an education institution should ""encourage"" (not sure what is the best word to describe this) this sort of behavior?to be fair, i know that the course have improved over the years because prof. damith always have listened to students' feedbacks and changed things accordingly. however, as of now, i think cs 2103 t is still a wip.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+dogshitcsstudentstana year agocs 2103 t review. taken in ay 23/24 semester 1 this course killed me. shout-out to my

because you can use it directly in the integrated terminal that most ides provide. furthermore, most ides have inbuilt source control features that is more convenient than sourcetree is. it will be a

computer science students.  for most computer science students, this module is twinned with cs 2101.  some students that are enrolled in special programmes (such as the university scholars programme, or a double degree programme where soc is not their home faculty) often do not need to take cs 2101.  cs 2103 t is the twinned version of this module, while cs 2103 is the non-twinned version.  lectures and exams are combined and they are identical for cs 2103 and cs 2103 t students.  however, cs 2103 t students form project groups with other cs 2103 t students only, because the same project group is required for cs 2101.  project groups are typically formed during the first cs 2101 class.the main reference material for this module is on this website (https://nus-cs 2103-ay 1819 s 1...).  there are two parts to this module - the lectures (which closely follow the reference website) and the group project.for most students, the group project takes up the bulk of time spent on this module.  students were required to either enhance an existing address book application (https://github.com/nus-cs 21...) or morph (i.e. convert) it for a different use case.  the ""morph"" route is considered the high-risk-high-reward option, because a failure to complete morphing the product is likely to result in an unusable application.  the address book application is written in java, and students will only be graded on the java code that they have written.  this project is graded on a number of aspects, including: product testing by peers and tutors, review of code and coding style, difficulty of your contributions (listed in your project portfolio page), and quality of documentation.the project group must consist of students from the same tutorial group; when i took the module, each group was required to contain at least one male, one female, one singaporean, and one non-singaporean student.  i recommend that you find a group of 3-5 people whom you are comfortable working with before the semester starts, and ballot for the same tutorial group.  this helps to alleviate much of the uncertainty with group work.  despite what cs 2101 tutors might suggest regarding group formation, having more groupmates who are experienced in writing medium-scale software is beneficial to the amount of polish you can give to the product (which results in better project grades).the lectures are about programming practices and design patterns (with a focus on oop in java), as well as working in a software development team.  they are geared towards working with medium- to large-scale software projects, and those intending to work in software engineering in the future.  the content for the final exam comes from the lectures and reference materials.  being sufficiently acquainted with the main reference material (the cs 2103/t website) will allow you to do well for finals.there are no midterms.  finals are closed-book (with help sheet).  the finals come in two parts - the first part is 100 true/false questions to be answered within an hour, and the second part is four open-ended questions to be answered within another hour.see more 10 replyshare ›show more

software development processes/workflows/tools and i agree. there is some amount of work to do, but since it is graded s/u the pressure is far lower, only to meet the minimum requirements. this does certainly help if someone has to learn the aforementioned processes/tools. it was not too difficult to learn/use, aside from maybe javafx being a bit arbitrary and slow. in terms of programming difficulty, it was also not significant by any stretch, and fears i had that it would massively and quickly build on 2030 s/2040 s knowledge were unfounded (yes, 2030 s knowledge is expected prerequisite knowledge, but this module doesn’t really require programming skills beyond that of 2030 s by any stretch).tpteam formation: as mentioned by other reviews, there was a diversity quota. a group could not have only singaporeans whose mother tongue is chinese, they needed either an ethnic minority or non-singaporean. gender diversity was encouraged but not required, but as there were a at least a few tutorial classes with only of 1 girl, it would not have been possible to enforce this. on a related note, i would recommend bidding for the course (during coursereg, not tutreg) with friends or people you can trust and work with, or at least those with similar ambitions in software development and grades, as that would make many aspects easier. i would also suggest working more closely together/sharing work more closely in tp, instead of trying to fragment/split the project and have everyone only work on one feature and be completely responsible for that feature, and not disregard the need for testing each others’ features when that comes up.tp weekly deliverables: it seemed like this also ramped up in an uneven way, i would have very much preferred for a heavier workload at the start of the project (not just doing documentation) rather than a mad crunch in the last 2 weeks. there is some work for doing releases every week, so be prepared for at least one team member to spend a couple of hours to do those things (writing release notes, creating a jar file).tp planning: identification of certain things, such as the target audience and value proposition of the product were a bit strange in the way they had to satisfy cs 2101’s pitch requirements too, and on the verge of being annoying. the constraints were rather limiting, and while i somewhat understand that some of those decisions were made to limit the workload, there was a lack of synchronisation (or to put it less charitably, some contradictions) between cs 2101 and cs 2103 t in the goals of the project/what we had to work towards (as if we were being pulled apart a little bit at the very end) made pitching in cs 2101 difficult.other than that, overall difficulty of tp was largely dependent on how ambitious groups were, and for my it wasn’t too bad, as my group was fairly realistic in setting goals and quite harmonious throughout.pein (only) one way, it was my favourite part of the module. the only reason i enjoyed pe was that testing the software of others, at least from the standpoint of a user, is not difficult and does not really test that much prior knowledge/experience, and only requires a bit of preparation and maybe a cheatsheet. in other words, i enjoyed it because it wasn’t as painful as cs 2030 s pes. and that’s the only good thing i have to say about the whole pe experience, now for my list of complaints:- a very short timeline between pe-d (dry run) and the final release. pe-d happened on w 12 friday, and the final submission/release was due on w 13 tuesday at 2 pm. that left basically just the weekend + monday for understanding/fixing around 45 (or so) bug reports.- the feature freeze. after pe-d, features are not allowed to be ‘enhanced’ anymore and only issues that are ‘strictly’ bugs could be fixed. as one might imagine, there was much ambiguity and sometimes outright contradictions in the instructions provided about this,  that left teams confused and caused them to waste time determining whether something is allowed, depending on which instruction is chosen to be followed, and how that instruction would be interpreted. for instance, what would be considered 'reasonable', 'correct' behaviour of software that 'one expects'? the immense subjectivity and variability of interpretations of such issues is a pain.- the timeline after the actual pe. after the pe, the testers have ~24 h to select up to 7 bugs to report to the dev team, then the dev team has ~36 h to respond, and then another ~60 h for the testers to respond. the decision to make the dev team respond and then testers respond to the bug reports seems to be an unnecessary use of time during reading week, especially when the module still has a final examination. in particular, asking a dev team to triage and respond (including justifying, which presumably would include evidence and a logical explanation) to 35 bugs seems like quite an ask, and even though my team averaged 7 minutes a bug we still took a grand 4 hours during reading week to respond, which just seems needlessly heavy. perhaps the teaching team could have reduced the maximum number of bugs that could be reported further, to 4 or 5. and like the complaint about instructions on the feature freeze above, having testers and developers debate over a bug, and only after that have the teaching team to 'choose' an explanation that seems 'more reasonable' seems to leave the door to subjectivity wide open too. it did not help that there were further contradictions and more confusing information about what bugs could be considered out of scope and what bugs could be outright rejected, with the criterion changing between the feature freeze and the pe.- the facade of collaborative learning. at every step of the way through pe, the teaching team tries to emphasise that there is a ‘learning outcome’ or a good ‘rationale’ for making certain choices that involve pitting one student against each another. be it to build better software, practice ‘grading bugs’ or the fact that somehow, it ‘isn’t a zero sum game’, it all rings hollow when considering their assessment design, that, if i were to be malicious, i would suggest is but an attempt to reduce the grading effort from the teaching team (they only have to choose a ‘more reasonable’ position among bug reports after seeing a two-sided debate, instead of finding bugs, for instance). it makes the whole pe process seem destructive, where trying to find bugs during pe-d is just an attempt to spam bug reports in hopes of getting the 2 bonus points (and then whether the tester actually gets those 2 depends on how the dev team chooses to respond, whether that’s in line with instructions or emotionally/defensively). furthermore, the teaching team asking testers for pe-d (who were portrayed as trying to do the dev team a favour by finding bugs) to now police the teams they tested for pe-d for potential feature freeze violations seemed rather extreme (and the email was sent out right as finals week was starting), which really makes it seem like a dog-eat-dog world (or maybe that’s what the swe industry is like, i guess i’ll find out in a couple of years) where self-centred individuals could easily choose to spend time tearing down/trying to penalise others.this zero sum game extends beyond the issue around reporting though, and to within teams themselves, where effort is graded at least partially, if not primarily on a peer review basis (although that already seems to be far more fair than something like proportion of functional code written, i should add). as highlighted by other reviews, team members could easily gang up on someone and mark them down in peer reviews (and thankfully this did not happen to me, but i have witnessed it happen to my peers in other classes), and the solution only seems to be to spend even more time and effort documenting contributions to functional code as evidence of their contributions should they get marked down. this zero sum game is also seen in the developer response to pe bugs, as the dev team can choose to assign the blame for bugs to certain members, which could result in in-fighting within teams as everyone wants to save their own grade (again, this did not happen to me but to peers i know), which is similarly a big waste of time. as mentioned earlier, my group chose to split blame for bugs equally, and already took 4 hours out of reading week exam prep to respond to/triage bugs, and this would have been far larger if we had decided to assign blame. thus, as you might be able to infer, the claims of pe not being zero sum and the environment being meant to be a collaborative one is merely a facade, with a system designed for everyone to tear everyone else apart at a moment’s notice. maybe covering ourselves is the defensive coding practice we were supposed to takeaway from this module.workloadquite heavy. remember how long you spent on your cs 2030 s labs/exercises? cs 2040 s problem sets? take that, but every weekend consistently, and a similar amount of content (though easier to understand) every week. it’s no wonder that this module is paired with cs 2101 (which is also unenjoyable but certainly lighter in workload), on it’s own i would say that it feels like at least a 6 unit course, not 4.the workload can get especially bad in the last 2 weeks, as cs 2101 also has deliverables in that time. as a result of all that, in the 8 days from week 12 to 13, my team spent almost 30 h on meetings and rehearsals.finalsperhaps the only good things i can say about finals are that the textbook contains a lot of information and can be used, and that prof damith does listen to feedback and tries to help. most other parts of the assessment ranged from irritating to discouraging. the finals was broken down into 3 components:part 1: 34 minutes, 16 mcq, search the textbook for answers relating to course content and a couple of questions about ip/tp.part 2: draw 3 uml diagrams in 20 minutes.part 3: 34 minutes, 16 mcq, questions were either about content in the textbook or the uml diagrams to be drawn.i personally have 2 complaints about finals: examplify and the difficulty. i think the biggest curse brought upon this generation, with the rise of remote learning and exam proctoring, is examplify. the software is unique, in that it is truly terrible (perhaps it is an example of where non-functional requirements should be considered!) in nearly every way imaginable. it is incredibly slow even on modern and powerful hardware, it does not use many ui or input ‘shortcuts’ that one would be used to with a modern computer like ctrl/cmd + backspace for deleting a word. navigation around the ui is extremely slow, and as far as user software goes, it is rather invasive. these issues aren’t really unique to cs 2103 t though, as it seems to be an nus-wide directive to conduct more exams on this travesty. to add to the woes, prof damith set examplify to disable backward navigation (meaning that once you answer a question, you cannot change your answer or see the question again), on the basis of ‘reducing cheating’ (what about a pen-and-paper exam then, ever considered that?), and randomised the order of the questions, which made it very difficult to estimate time required or plan out the approach to answering the questions. he suggests that one should just take 2 minutes per question and still have time to spare, but does not accommodate for a) the fact that some questions are simply more difficult/take longer than others or b) the fact that some students are just better at some topics than others. furthermore, examplify’s ‘exam attachment’ system (where exam setters can add attachments) is probably the worst part of the software, being a floating window that is incredibly slow to drag around the screen, only scaling from one corner, not scrolling from page to page smoothly, not supporting any trackpad gestures for zooming, and best of all, taking one to two orders of magnitude longer than most pdf readers to search through a pdf (quite seriously, search in apple preview or microsoft edge on the exam pdf takes much less than half a second, while examplify’s search took 5 seconds on some macbooks and 10-30 seconds on some windows laptops. what year is this?). fortunately, prof damith responded to feedback in the forum about this and removed the pdf, asking students to download the pdf separately and use adobe acrobat pdf reader instead (which isn’t quite as bad, but still one of the slower and worse pdf readers out there in my opinion), and set the exam to non-secure mode so that adobe pdf reader could be accessed as well. however, there still was an attachment for part 3, which was code, and could only be accessed through examplify. as for the difficulty, prof damith did say that the exam would be of similar difficulty to the mock paper provided, but in my and all of my friends’ opinions, it was much harder, particularly for part 1, many of us struggled to finish the part owing to the difficulty of the questions, while part 2 and 3 were slightly more manageable.closing thoughtsthis is unfortunately a compulsory module. i agree with the basis of learning swe practices and methods/workflows, and much of what i learnt is rather practical and can be put into use in internship/interviews relating to swe. however, the execution of the later half of the module is something to watch out for, between the astronomically high workload that is enabled by blended learning, the huge ambiguity and some contradictions in the instructions towards the end of tp and during the pe, and the possible disagreements/tension within teams that in my opinion is a result of the design of the assessment. finals isn’t a whole lot better too, but some of that can be blamed on nus. perhaps the main saving grace of this module is that supposedly somewhere between 80 and 90% of the previous cohort got a b+ or better.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+cchong chin herng 10 months agotaken in ay

we weren't even allowed to stray far from the base tp app we were given to build on. a lot of effort has been made to reduce our workload, and it actually worked — the base level of work needed isactuallyreally low.however, many teams still go above and beyond to introduce complicated features, creating unnecessary work for themselves, but perhaps it was beneficial for their own learning. maybe find a group that aligns with your best interests if you aren't looking to write 5 k lines of code when 1 k suffices.in fact, since the practical exam makes you catch bugs in another team's app where each bug you catch gives you credit and penalises the opposing team's score, unnecessary extra features inevitably introduce extra bugs that come back to bite you.about practical: given the dog-eat-dog context, it gets unpleasant as people will try to catch anything in your app as a bug (and vice-versa — insist that the obvious bug in their app that you caught is actually a feature). it's frustrating and honestly also quite entertaining how ridiculous the back-and-forth can get. see for yourself!i thought the obsession with uml (see uml mafia review below) was indeed a bit much, especially during the pedantic final exam that just consisted of drawing and judging silly uml diagrams. 30% of our entire grade rested on identifying whether a diagram had rounded or square boxes, filled or dotted lines, etc.however, i have to say it was also refreshing to have a core cs exam be so chill as it was open book and there was no memorising or even much thinking involved. if you pay attention during the weekly content reading and tutorials, it'll be quite easy.initially i expected this to be a horrible experience, especially given my immense hatred for cs 2030 s and dislike for coding in general. but thanks to my awesome teammates and a reduced workload, this course actually turned out quite easy-going. i grew more confident working with larger codebases, collaborating with

damithgrading: (50%) team project, (15%) individual project, (5%) participation, (30%) finaloverall, this module has quite high workload. contentwise, this mod is pretty much self-study mod. what you do every week is just reading the content allocated to each week on the course website and work out the quizes on canvas for participation mark. this takes less than 1 ~ 2 hours per week since the amount of content is not very much. that being said, i feel examinable materials for final exam is not very much.individual project is the same across every year; the project is to create a chatbot with simple oop technique. if you have taken cs 2030(s), you can breeze through and get full mark for this component (most people get 15/15). although individual project is not very difficult, it serves an important role for learning branch workflow & git & design patterns, which you need for tp.team project is the most time consuming part. within a month, our team wrote 10 k+ lines of code for the tp. every weekend, our team had weekly meeting about 4 ~ 6 hours to consolidate our deliverables and discuss code designs. coding out the new features is not very difficult, but you need to do lots of other stuffs that you probably don't want to be bothered with such as writing test cases, reveiw other people's code, crafting user guide or drawing uml diagrams. all the above combined took majority of my time for the second half of this semester, and i felt i am squandering huge portion of my time doing the random bs above. regardless of the workload, it was pleasant experience to work in a very active and deligent team. my teammates were very good, and i was lucky to be with them:)team project involves practical exam where you need to review other team's product in 1.5 hours and report the bug found. it's quite chill since all you need to do is being meticulous and dig out bugs.although the contents of this module is easy, final exam was difficult. finally exam is composed of 2 parts. for the first part, you need to answer 16 mcq/mrq questions on the swe theory. this part was extremely tricky where they tested every possible nit picks i can think of from the textbook. i needed to ctrl-c v for the entire exam to find out where that nit pick is from, and as a result, i ran out of my time and choked very hard. second part is composed of 16 mcq/mrq questions on uml diagrams. fortunately, this part was very standard. as long as you revised how to draw uml diagrams, it will be quite manageable.overall, the biggest takeaway is on learning how to use git workflow and test the product critically, but other than that, i feel most of contents taught were not very useful in the actual swe industry. i don't recommend overloading too hard with this module.enjoyment:

you are in the right team. expect some conflicts and discussions since this is pretty much 5 people trying to get some ideas across to each other. you can also do the bare minimum here and get full marks, though i think it would be more fun to develop crazier stuff with it.usefulness: 8/10 common developmental approaches are taught, and the design patterns used in creating programs. these are instrumental for internship and can be asked by interviewers. apart from that, uml diagrams and some documentations are not used much internally, unless you are working on open-source projects. with the wise words of my internship superior : ""i can read your code, we are all technically trained"", as i present to him my codes with documentation. i think he has a poor reasoning, and i sure hope he doesn't read this review.experience: 7/10 generally it was fun, with the exception of bug testing. the idea of trading marks with someone (someone catch your ""bug"", you lose marks and he gains some) just makes it unfun. often times, it results in a lot of poor quality issues caught (with the time limit to catch bugs), which are mostly out of scope or fake ""bugs"" that are not even there. my team has about 70+ bugs and honestly i only appreciated like 7 of the bugs. about 30 are reasonable, the rest just puts ""???"" on my head.another point is that if you do the bare minimum for the team project, you will have lesser bugs (you can't have many bugs if you don't implement many things). so if you plan to game the system, you know what to do.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies

foreigner, and be different from cs 2103 t group), but the requirements were dropped for the semester i took the module, and we could form any group we want. groups are strictly size 4-5.even before the module started, the cancer of finding groupmates started. instead of choosing groupmates randomly from tutorial groups, many people already pre-formed a group with their friends, and they would all bid for the same tutorial slot. this is very hard to coordinate due to timetable clashes, and this was aggravated by the late announcement of the cs 2103 t and cs 2101’s tutorial group pairings. eventually, i found a group of 5. the only common slot available for us was the 8 am slot, unfortunately. as no one likes to wake up at 8 am, the class size was quite small, having only 16 people. note that this number ""16"" is very special mathematically, that it doesn't allow groups of size 5, because 4*4=16. at the end, our group of 5 had to be split up into 2/3. so, i'd recommend pre-forming groups of size 4, and not 5.unlike cs 2030, we were not forced to use vim, and were actually encouraged to use powerful ides.this module teaches basic software engineering concepts, such as uml, git, ides, unit testing, etc. the concepts would be put into practice in the module project, which is to work on an address book app.  this module has a brown field approach to software engineering, meaning we don't start on a new project from scratch, but instead, take on an existing project (address book) with a very large code base. we could either choose to enhance the address book, or morph it into something else. most people chose to morph it.because the code base is very large, working on the app becomes very tedious. every little change that we did likely had some consequences. for example, just by changing the behaviour of the app a bit to make the queries case insensitive, many of junit testcases start to fail, and we would have to modify/remove the testcases, despite only changing a few lines of code in the logic. tracing the code was also very tedious. after this project, i never want to see another address book.though tedious, being able to work with a large codebase is an extremely useful skill, as we would likely be working on an existing project when we go out for internships. although i did not enjoy working on the project, i felt that it has helped me in my current internship.instead of a midterm, there was a practical, where we tested other group's project, to find bugs. it was held in i 3 using our own laptops, on nus wifi. the wifi went down instantly, and many people had to use their mobile data to download the .jar file, or borrow from their friends. the wifi was quite cancer.we had very little feedback about our marks. all the feedback regarding marks were told to us via a bot on github, to the point where we joked that the module is run by a bot.the theory content is not too hard, but there is a lot of content. luckily, the exam is open book. even though it's open book, it is quite a waste of paper to print out the 80-page textbook.unlike other cs modules with clear right-or-wrong answers, and types of questions asked during the exam were more ""open"". there was a question that asked us to design an architecture diagram, and write some reasoning with it, which can be pretty vague and i have no idea what or how much they expect us to write. we couldn't practice much either, as the solutions for the past year papers weren't given, so we didn't have a model answer to refer to.final grade:

for those interested to find out more.workload: in the first lecture, prof akshay mentioned that the workload will be similar to other 4 mc level 2 k cs modules. however, i certainly did not feel that this was the case as i spent a lot of time working on the project. in my opinion, the workload of cs 2103 without the exam is already higher than other similar modules.the module taught us how to use git, which is a revision control software. git is a really useful tool as it helps us to save the right versions of anything we want to work on. it saves you the trouble of and saving 10 different copies and manually tracking down the changes between each save.the module project, which is worth 50% of the module grade, involved morphing an existing project address-book level 4 (ab 4).  for many people, this is the first time working together on something in a team. do take note that you can only team with people from your tutorial group, which makes going with your friend difficult (more so if you need to twin this module with cs 2101).the project is individually graded although you work together in teams of 4 or 5. each person's contribution to the project will be recorded by git software. each person also submits a personal project portfolio (ppp) to indicate which sections of the user and developer guide he/she contributed, which is used by the teaching team to keep track of how much work each person did.that being said, having a good team can help you keep track of what needs to be done and navigate through the huge maze of requirements. there were milestones to meet almost every week which are checked by a bot, with instructions all on the module website. however, i felt that the instructions were often confusing and difficult to follow. due to the numerous requirements, it is often easy to miss out some of them. as such, it might be valuable to have someone in your team who can read instructions carefully and remind the rest of the team to get the appropriate things done.each of us were required to implement a feature. this naturally raises the question of a ""feature"" is and whether your feature is significant enough. several students tried to ask if their feature is good enough, which the profs refused to answer them, leaving the students to decide on their own.compared to other cs modules, this module tends to have more subjective grading rubrics where it is somewhat less clear if you meet a certain requirement or not. some of the criteria includes:most of the target users are likely to find the app worth using.the product looks well-designed.the feature has all functionality to be useful to almost all users.i guess that i just have to accept this as part of software engineering involves thinking about what your clients want and thinking from the end user's point of view. this is different from other areas of cs like algorithms where there is little ambiguity most of the time.there is very little feedback on the module. in general, i feel that there is too much freedom and not enough guidance- leading to many students lost and not knowing what to do at times.given the somewhat subjective grading and the little feedback on the module, many students have no idea what they did well or didn't do well. i know teams who feel that they contributed the same amount of effort into the project but still ended up with wildly varying grades from b- to a (but this could perhaps be due to the exam).see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+jjaycee_disqus 7 years agohi, there are more module reviews here

pain to your team and suck up all of your free time for the second half of this semester. in groups of 4,  you're supposed to set your own the requirements for the final product you want to have at the end of the module, modify existing features and add new features to an existing code base: addressbook 4 to make those features happen. and at the same time, each person will play different roles in the group e.g. project lead, code integrator, project management, documentation. you're also expected to apply the content mentioned above (design principles, design patterns, proper project management, maintaining high code quality, write good documentation) with deadlines on a weekly basis (your v 1.0 to v 1.5 project milestones)there are way too many things for a single person to do but that's why you have 3 other group mates to work with. and that bring us to the next point, choosing team members. it's best to choose teammates that are motivated and capable. so, see those exchange students who are here to party, travel the world and do the bare minimum? yea, probably not them. that person notorious for consistently submitting substandard work late? nope. you get the idea... one quirk is that unlike other nus modules, the peer reviews here counts as part of your grade so don't expect to do nothing for the whole project and still expect good peer review scores.finally, with 40% of the grade in finals, your team can only help you so much. you'll still have to depend on own effort. apparently, the exam format was changed this semester (133 true-false questions with negative marking + 4 open-ended design questions) so it was much harder to predict. i guess the best thing would be to practice drawing the uml diagrams and getting your foundation

other than dr damith, but i believe that dr henry chia has really done a good job. the module covers all the content given by dr damith, but where dr henry improves on it is to make information more accessible for students and easily understandable. this module focuses more on practical real-life skills in programming rather than theory. for polytechnic students, it is the closest thing to the projects that we used to do in polytechnic that required you to create a prototype application.this is one of the most fun and challenging module that i had this semester. creating a working application was really fun, you will be forced to take initiative to pick up new skills that are not taught within the module in order to polish your project. also the module focuses on your coding style not your actual coding skills, to make sure that it is up to snuff when you go into the working world. that being said, the workload comes fast and furious in the 2 nd half of the semester when you only have a week between each iteration of your project.this is a very fulfilling and fun module if you enjoy programming and would love to create an actual working application, but be prepared for the heavy workload that comes with it. if you can keep up, this would definitely be a fun module.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+nusmodsmoderator 11 years agomodule review by lim xian

CS2106,"This course introduces the basic concepts in operating systems and links it with contemporary operating systems (eg. Unix/Linux and Windows). It focuses on OS structuring and architecture, processes, memory management, concurrency and file systems. Topics include kernel architecture, system calls, interrupts, models of processes, process abstraction and services, scheduling, review of physical memory and memory management hardware, kernel memory management, virtual memory and paging, caches, working set, deadlock, mutual exclusion, synchronisation mechanisms, data and metadata in file systems, directories and structure, file system abstraction and operations, OS protection mechanisms, and user authentication."," −+jotham wong 6 months agoafter you have mastered the basics of dressing, eating, grooming, and basic conversation,

implementationsreviewas the title suggests, this course is about operating systems. i feel that this course can be roughly divided into two main parts, processes and threads and related topics, and ram. the 1 st half was tested in midterms, while the 2 nd half  was tested in finals. this mod is quite info dumpy and reminded me of cs 2105 slightly. prof jialin handled lectures for the 1 st half while prof colin handled lectures for the 2 nd half, and all lectures were recorded. there was an extra recorded zoom lecture in week 12 or 13 since we were slightly behind on the content. i think both profs were decent at teaching the topics, personally i like prof colin's lectures, his vibes reminds me of prof aaron a bit.as usual, there are 4 labs in cs 2106. all of the labs are generally quite guided, but i feel they were slightly long, and there are some parts where you have to figure out how to implement it on your own. roughly 2 weeks were given for each lab. you would also have to do a demo for each lab where you run some of the code you wrote. this is the only thing you have to do in the lab slot, you can skip the lab slot if you're already done demoing/plan to demo in a future week. for my semester, lab 1 was about memory allocation in c and building a simple phonebook using malloc. lab 2 was shell scripting and process programming. lab 3 was synchronization mechanisms. lab 4 was contiguous memory allocation and we replaced malloc from the phonebook in lab 1 with our custom malloc. for all labs, we were allowed to work in pairs, and you don't necessarily have to work with the same partner each time. i worked with the same partner for all 4 labs, and for labs 1-3 we would just do the lab individually then compare and fix/combine answers before submitting. for lab 4 i was getting a bit overwhelmed by my other modules, so i ended up mostly just copying my partner's lab, hence the lower time spent.midterm consisted of 20 2 pt mcq items for 1 hour, and one a 4 cheatsheet was allowed. it was kinda annoying how a few of the questions were basically an api check on c memory allocation functions. time felt a bit tight as i only had a few minutes left when i finished. finals format was rather bizarre with a total of 78 marks. it was held via examplify, and we were allowed to access any locally saved or printed materials. there were 5 2 pt mcq questions at the start, then the remaining 68 marks all came from fitb items. there were 5 main items, each of which gave a certain scenario involving memory management, then asked you to compute some values such as the smallest value that causes a segfault or the largest file size that can be stored given an inode specification. they all just asked the final answer, so careless mistakes can be brutal.there was also an issue where the grade for the labs was only recorded for the partner who submitted the lab (only one person had to submit for each pair) due to a miscommunication. this resulted in some people getting 0 for all labs and dropping to cs, ds, and fs. my partner and i happened to submit 2/4 labs each so our grades were fine (originally b+ for me), so i didn't realize something was off. after people started bringing this up, prof colin did eventually admit his mistake with an apology email and tried to fix it asap. the grades finally got fixed on jan 16, 2024.i don't really have any strong feelings for this module. it was conducted alright (aside from the grade issue) and wasn't super heavy. i can see why this class is important though, since it does give a nice overview on how operating systems work (and i finally know what a segfault means when using c++). i personally found the lectures on memory management to be fairly interesting.rating- workload - 7/10- difficulty - 8/10- enjoyment - 5/10 available assessment statsmidterm (/40)- 5 number summary - 0/24/28/32/39- mean - 17.6 expected grade: b+actual grade: a (??? i

slides were clearly not created by either of them, and, as a result, when they teach, they use fillers and analogies that don’t make sense.personally, i feel prof. anandha is biologically not capable of teaching; his voice breaks every 2 sentences. he likes to give fillers that don’t contribute to learning at all. for example, he says, “this is a really, really, really cool concept,” but the lecture slides have no implementation, and he just mentions it in a few sentences. it’s evident his preparation is minimal, as he mentioned in the file system lecutre that “the night before the lecture he took a look at the slides.” previously, he taught 2100, and it was the same zero-preparation thing again: he seemed to enjoy his own world, saying that certain topics were not tested in the midterm but then testing them anyway, and doing nothing except saying, “oh, we can’t test you guys on these topics without this topic,” when multiple people had asked and he had said they were not tested.but i have to credit him to say that he replies to people on the forum, which is good.tuning into the lecture has been frustrating because the lecture slides contain minimal information about the real concepts—just a picture—and the profs can’t be bothered to add the actual implementation. half the time you’re just listening to the prof yapping then next slide.my tutorial ta has disappeared for the last five weeks. one minute before the tutorial, he would tell us he couldn’t come to class, saying he had an exam during the tutorial slot; twenty minutes into the tutorial, he would claim he’s sick.the good thing is that prof. colin listens to feedback, and the midterm and finals were set well.midterm: 40/45 finals: idk juz takenedit: tldr: second worst cs mod ranking after

inter-process communication, threads, synchronisation, memory abstraction, memory management, disjoint memory schemes, virtual memory, file systems implementationassessmenttutorials: 5% (including weekly lecture quizzes as well)labs: 25%. this was split into 4 labs, with all being equal weightage. lab reports could be done in pairs, but code demonstrations were individual. lab 1 was on c, 2 on bash/shell scripting, 3 on synchronisation, 4 on memory allocation. workload could vary, but my lab partner and i spent anywhere between 2 and 5 hours working on a lab assignment + report. all labs required some amount of code demonstration + answering questions from the lab ta about the code written, and all but the last one required submission of code. labs had to be done on a linux distro and there were some libraries used that only ran on linux (although there was no requirement for doing on x 86). the first lab was perhaps the most painful one as it required writing c code for the first time in a long time (since the last that most people might have used c for was early cs 2100 labs), build data structures and ensure that there were no memory leaks. the prof and my lab ta were also not clear on the requirements about memory freed when the test cases ended, resulting in my lab partner and me wasting over an hour trying to find a nonexistent memory leak where memory was not freed up because of an issue with the test case. subsequent labs were less painful and perhaps slightly more interesting, but in my experience had a smaller workload. there was generally about 1 week between the lab assignment being explained by the ta and the demo to be done (in the following lab session), and then just under a week to submit the report.midterm: 20%. this midterm had 20 questions which were all mcq, and was open book, but seems to have been hurriedly set, with some of the printing being unclear, some typos and some questions being a bit ambiguous (resulting in the profs accepting more answers later). however, there was one question where the code did not compile due to syntax issues, and when informed after the paper, the profs took over a week to respond to an email about it, and decided that they would not accept an additional answer that would be technically correct, on the grounds that it was an os exam and not a c programming exam. it seemed a bit arrogant, in my opinion, to not own a mistake and just accept an additional answer with the expectation that a student would correctly guess the prof’s intent (who knows if it’s meant to be a trick question or not?), but given the number of mistakes made in the setting of that one paper, i might be left to infer that the teaching team is somewhat overworked or hurried in their setting of assignments/assessments.finals: 50%. this was perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this course. the format of the final seems to have changed drastically from semester to semester, with this semester’s being open book, on examplify, and all short-response questions. while previous years’ papers had a mix of topics throughout the semester and were out of 100 marks, or had some mcq, this exam had only post-midterm topics (memory and storage) and was only 50 marks. the teaching team had also mentioned that we were still expected to know pre-midterm topics and that they could be tested, but then proceeded to test none of them. they also mentioned an expectation of the prerequisite knowledge (cs 2100), and indeed caching from that was used. tragically, examplify was used, but at least that allowed for an open-book exam with any sort of digital notes (that could be opened in ms office or a local, non-browser pdf reader of choice). owing to examplify’s extremely size-restricted ui and horrendous scrolling, it was very difficult to read an entire question and refer to earlier information at a go, with text and answer boxes being far too big and non-resizable, requiring a lot of painfully slow and inaccurate scrolling just to refer to information provided in the question. i resorted to copying information from the question onto a piece of paper and referring to that instead. the questions themselves were not easy, but also not undoably difficult, though felt a bit more difficult than previous years’. in particular, there were certain tricky elements to many questions that required careful attention, as missing a single detail could cost many marks. by far the most infuriating part of finals, though, was the fact that single final answers to questions were all that determined the marks a question could have, and since there was no way to submit working in examplify, final answers to a long and immensely tedious calculation question could be worth 6 marks at a go (that’s 6% of the overall grade!). it again seemed lazy or hurried, that such a paper set where such a significant portion of the overall grade was set based on one line answers, and it wasn’t like the paper was without errors (the teaching team did have to make announcements and clarifications during the paper too), without little thought to grade the approach to the question and not just the final answer. a little fun fact: at least 48.25% of the overall grade for this module is on the topic of memoryworkload:not too large, and if anything, slightly less than cs 2100. lectures were 2 h a week and recorded (with the weekly lecture quizzes being available till the end of the week), and the turnout in the lt was strong throughout the semester. i would like to add that both prof jialin and colin are enthusiastic and very knowledgeable, and generally good at explaining concepts in a way that helped me understand the real-world applicability. tutorials were 1 h a week with a few questions, attendance was graded, and the questions were decently helpful for understanding the concepts taught in lecture.closing thoughts:this is a module with interesting content. it covers the fundamentals of computing, building on and further abstracting what was taught in cs 2100. i do believe that the topics are somewhat or quite applicable to the real-world, especially if you intend to pursue focus areas that involve understanding lower-level aspects of a computer. i particularly thought that topics like threads, synchronisation and memory were somewhat interesting, although storage seems a bit dated since a lot of the abstractions and theories thought there apply to magnetic hard drives that fewer and fewer consumers use daily.that being said, i feel that there is still some room for improvement when it came to the organisation of the module, especially in the way the assessed components were set/conducted. while mistakes in the lab assignments aren’t the end of the world since they only led to me spending more time than i otherwise would have. but as for midterms and finals, i feel that they should have been more thoroughly vetted, or considered allowing students to better showcase their understanding of concepts through more open-ended questions, instead of having only mcq in midterms and only short-response questions in finals where only the final answer was graded. more consistency between semesters, and better availability of pyps and answers, could also have helped me prepare better for finals.see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+zaia month

anandha's teaching okay. at least i took away certain degree of understanding of the core contents from every lecture. however, delivery of content for the second half was not very clear due to prof's unique voice and sharp intonation with lots of filler expressions such as ""this is very very cool,"" frankly speaking. after every lecture, i needed to look for some youtube videos or blog posts to solidify my understanding of contents since some of them are not well-explained enough that i don’t have my own pictures in my mind. moreover, as some people have pointed out, profs did not prepare thoroughly before the lecture which frequently incurs in a situation where what prof explains do not match with the lecture slides.contentwise, it shares similar taste with cs 2100. has lots of memorization but also needs to understand the algorithms arising from os memory management, scheduling, synchronization and file system. the only tricky part of this module i feel is hybrid threads and hierarchical paging.fortunately, my tutorial ta, jotham wong, is just an os god. he is extremely knowledge in os. i learnt much more from my tutor than lectures. he starts off with recap for the lecture contents, and most of my doubts from the lectures are resolved by his explanation. of course tutorial goes smoothly, and he usually covers more than compulsory questions. the best thing is that he is very active and responsive over telegram & extremely clear with his explanation. whenever we ask questions, he usually responds within at most 1 hour and he shares them in the group chat if the questions are helpful for the other students. almost all of my doubts from the lectures are cleared by the above two-step process, and extra learning from other students’ questions helped me a lot to revise.lab assignments were tedious and sometimes painful, but overall doable within at most 5-6 hours. they were in general helpful to have hand-on os experience and regurgitate lecture content.one thing i think the teaching team did really well is how they set the exam paper. both mid and final are manageable and well set. both exams have a similar nature where around half of questions are os related mcq/mrq qns (sort of like os trivia qns) and the rest half was tracking algorithms we learnt such as hierarchical paging, page replacement, i-node system, scheduling algorithms…etc. those questions can be solved fairly easily once student has revised the content enough & attempted tutorials. thus, the exam curve was quite gentle (avg 29/45, 73/100 for mid and

content is incredibly in-depth in my opinion. both prof jialin and prof colin teach pretty well. unfortunately, what prof colin covers in lectures and what shows up in tutorials / final exam is completely different. it makes it quite hard to study for exams.tutorials - pretty straightforward. try to solve it before you go in, or its a waste of time. my ta was quite good at explaining concepts and was very helpful when the professors were vague in lectures. class participate here and there to get your 5%.midterm - 20 mcq paper, not too bad but relatively tricky. they changed it to be closed book this semester for some reason, so we were allowed only one cheatsheet. other than that it was pretty standard.labs - tbh i found them pretty easy, though that might be due to my prior experience with c++ and c. but a lot of people say they found the labs hard, so it might be worthwhile to partner with someone (you're allowed to partner with people even outside your lab group. also, you don't lose marks for submitting with a second person, unlike some other modules, like cs 2105).finals - the final exam was very weird. completely different from previous years. they changed the policy again to make it open book. prof colin mentioned certain terms maybe once in the lecture and they weren't even part of any tutorials or the slides either, but then they show up in the exam - which is quite frustrating and demoralising as well. time is of the essence, and as its on examplify you don't get method marks either. it's hard to estimate how you've done.overall, i enjoyed the

21/22 sem 2 under profs djordje jevdjic and colin tan.summary:the content was useful but superficial. the labs were uninteresting. the module is somewhat difficult but that's mainly because of the amount of content taught and the lack of association with real-world examples. the workload was highly manageable and less than cs 2040 s, cs 2030 s, and cs 2100.topics:processes and threads, process scheduling, inter-process communication, synchronization, memory management (including virtual memory) and file systems. most concepts were taught in relation to how unix works such as unix syscalls. specific file system case studies include ext 2 and fat.content:like cs 2100, cs 2106 is a ""content"" module where quite a lot of content is taught and the bulk of the work lies in understanding it.i was disappointed at how abstract most of the topics taught were. the professors could've brought in examples of real-world implementations of the topics, such as those in the linux kernel.professors:the professors' teaching didn't leave much of an impression on me. they explain concepts well and it was enjoyable listening to their lectures.that said, there were some gaps in teaching. to fill in those gaps, i had to conduct self-research on some topics and ask questions on the forum. there were also weekly office hours for students to consult the professors.workload:- a  2-hour lecture per week. does not contribute to grades.- a 1-hour tutorial per week. does not contribute to grades.- a graded quiz every week. takes about 10 minutes on average to complete.- 4 graded lab assignments spread over the course of the semester.- a 2-hour midterm- a 2-hour finalthe lecture slides were incomplete and were not understandable alone so i had to watch all the lectures. the tutorials were not strictly necessary for doing well, but they helped reinforce concepts and teach techniques to answer questions.the labs required us to implement programs that demonstrated os concepts. we were given around 2 weeks to complete each lab, which was usually more than enough time. i found the labs disappointing. they could've been designed to be more insightful, such as by letting us implement simple os subsystems.enjoyment: 5/10 difficulty: 7/10 workload: 5/10 importance/usefulness for a cs grad: 9/10 see more 10 replyshare ›−+zhao wei liewzhao wei liew 3 years

bernardexpected: a+received: a+graded components: tutorial quizzes, midterms, labs, finals.this should be the next module you take after cs 2100 (modrekt notwithstanding). it's quite a fun module with a good lecturer. i believe sem 2 is conducted with ""uncle soo"" (prof soo yuen jien), so your mileage may vary. people say he's good as well though. the unfortunate thing about this module is that it only covers topics at a very basic level, and it's been bought out by the mips mafia as well, like cs 2100 before it. (but only for one lecture).topics covered include:- operating system fundamentals- process scheduling algorithms- memory management- virtual memory (paging, segmentation)- page replacement algorithms- multiprocess/thread synchronisation- filesystems (fat, ext 2)- memory interprocess communication (pipes, shared memory)disk scheduling was not covered for this semester.imo there was too much time spent covering things that aren't relevant to a cs undergrad's life in an intro course -- batch scheduling/processing algorithms and segmentation, for one.if you are not that comfortable with these topics, i do not recommend skipping the lecture.1. tutorialshao wei is a really good tutor that tries to cram a lot of extra knowledge (esp. related to the practical aspects of stuff discussed in the lecture, like specifics on how the linux kernel does things). he also helped students with lab questions, which is great. i don't believe there's a participation component for tutorials. there is, however, a quiz component -- just a 3-5 mcqs at the end of the tutorial that should be fairly easy to get.it's probably good to do the tutorials beforehand, but eventually i just gave up.2. labsyou are expected to have a reasonable grasp of c for some reason, even though cs 2100 just barely scratches the surface of it. labs are quite interesting and varied, covering topics like synchronisation (eg. locking), process management (kill/signal, fork), shared memory, and memory management (one of the labs was to write a memory allocator a-la malloc).each lab has several ""parts"" that are graded either 1 or 2 marks; it shouldn't be that hard to score a decent mark. if you're stuck, please ask your ta! they're usually more than willing to help. each lab also has a bonus component that can make up for lost marks elsewhere.3. examsfor both midterms and finals, it was a quiz on luminus, with a mix of mostly mcq, and some short response questions. not much coding is necessary, and for the questions needing it, c-like pseudocode will suffice. cheatsheets were allowed, so it is very important to get a good cheatsheet if you need it.while there were 4 (or 5?) lab assignments, as well as tutorials that seemed to be getting more and more tedious (hence i stopped doing them), each lab typically spans 2 or 3 weeks, so it is a good idea to try and get them done as soon as possible, so that you have time to (a) try to figure out why it doesn't work, and (b) ask your ta for help not at the last minute. if you do that, the workload should be manageable.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+oowen 4 years agoediteday 2020/2021 s 1 (full online sem) cristina carbunarumodule difficulty/contents:this module is difficult, no doubt. the contents consist of processes, memory, and storage, which can be pre-studied through the ostep online textbook.the difficulty of this module arises not really from the content, but that the design decisions made for the implementation of each component also need to be understood to achieve a decent grade for the module. as a result, some of the questions ask if a certain implementation taught in the lecture was done differently, or if various methods are combined together, etc.another difficulty arises during lab sessions, since they involve using posix library calls written in c, which are generally daunting for students. knowing how to read and understand unix man pages for the system calls is important, but because unix is quite advanced the system calls also contain advanced options, which make things more confusing. however, even if you know how to use the man pages, finding the correct function to use is also another skill needed for the module.i am incredibly grateful for both my lab and tutorial tas (bernard and hao wei) who were approachable and answered my questions about some quirks of the system calls. additionally, taking this mod with friends will also make things easier, since you can learn from each other's mistakes in the lab assignment.the midterms and exams were a mix of mcq and saq.workload:very heavy. it is incredibly important to keep up with the module every week, as some weeks build up on previous weeks.additionally, the lab assignments never stop (i.e. the due date for an assignment is followed by the opening of another in the same week), and there is a need to present your solution (to the first question of the lab, usually a simple problem) to the lab ta, to ensure that you are on the right track. i rarely finished a lab more than a week before the due date of the lab assignment.tutorials are also graded, as there are lecture quizzes after the tutorial recapping the concepts introduced in the lecture and addressed in the tutorial.grade breakdown:10% tutorial

teaching.you can either be a lab ta or tutorial ta. i know most of you that apply for this want to be a lab ta for obvious reasons.tutorial tas are paid under the following formula: 11 (weeks of tutorial) * number of classeslab tas are paid under the following formula: 10(weeks of lab) * number of classes + 12(grading hours) * number of classesbecause nus refuses to pay tas for tutorial preparation, tutorial tas are severely underpaid. i cannot imagine having to prepare to teach operating systems and i highly respect those that can even do a passable job at this.there’s really nothing to say about the job scope as you can probably infer this from being in the labs yourself. for each consulting session, i prepare slides shortly going over the overarching theme of each question and the requirements for the demo session. you really can’t go too much into detail because that part’s graded. grading may be confusing at times as open ended questions have various branching answers, especially when it comes to code. i love hanging out with my students tho.colin is notoriously known among students for his issues with administration tasks, but i think although partially true, he does have too much on his plate as being the only admin for a course of 600+ students, dealing with management overhead is not a trivial task, and i respect him for having to deal with all this, despite it being infuriating having to deal with such consequences. the section below is just to rant about some behind the scenes issues.fun fact: i wasn’t expecting to be teaching this course 1.5 years after taking this course. with no email of recognition or any confirmation of consent, this course appeared in my teaching contract out of nowhere, almost gave me a heart attack and made me doubt whether i had amnesia or not. i wrote an email to colin to confirm which he never acknowledged and sent a google form to all other tas confirming slot availability. as i already had other high-intensity commitments i knew if i took up teaching tutorials i might as well book a room at imh or ucs, so i sent an email asking whether i could take labs instead. i ended up having to physically go down to the lecture session to confirm this with him, so yeah man isn’t the most responsive on emails, or telegram also. there was this instance where we had to confirm our claims before a certain deadline, and colin decided to be unreachable for 1 whole week, claiming to be on leave, he really takes his leaves seriously and i swear if one day he goes missing no one would report this to the police. anandha on the other hand, is much more responsive (bro replied to my email on a sunday midnight) however did not have much power on the issues mentioned as he’s just a new prof.anyway here are some interesting moments i had when hosting labs:i added a custom test case on one of the live demo sessions and made everyone panic because no input validation was stated in the lab sheet and i sent everyone into panic mode, eventually overrunning the lab session. i stopped adding custom test cases after that incident.one time colin hosted a tutorial on zoom and it coincided with my lab timeslot, so i streamed the tutorial instead for the consultation session. (less than 10 students came)there was this student who was unusually hyperactive. when i asked him to compile files he would name the binary after me. it was kinda funny.i also met one of my last semester students by complete chance. he helped me buy lunch because i had to rush to my lab slot right after one of my midterms. thanks very much.tldr i had more fun teaching this course than i expected. probably not teaching again tho idksee more 00 replyshare ›−+jotham wongi sleep in com 14 days agothe formula for the tutorial ta is wrong. we do get paid 1 hour for each tutorial's

anandhaafter the bad experience of cs 2100, i was worried this mod would be a repeat of that (in terms of workload and amount of info crammed). thankfully, content was much more interesting (personally) especially the topics on scheduling, synchronization and threads.lectures were taught by prof colin before midterms and i felt that his teaching was quite effective and explained things quite well. however, the slides were definitely old (it says ay 18/19 s 1 on it) and there were things he mentioned that were not on the slides (such as how monolithic os can be thought of as a big program but not actually compiled as 1 big program, this wasn't in the slides but came out in midterms), so taking down notes while watching the lecture was important.the 2 nd half of content focusing on files was taught by prof anandha. while i appreciate his passion and openness to feedback (props to him for fixing the slides to make it not overlaid and answering the questions on ed), his lectures are quite hard to follow. he uses a lot of analogies which are helpful, but his points feel somewhat over the place.. in some way (iykyk). overall, i found it harder to understand the concepts taught and relied on other sources to learn.labs were definitely more time consuming than cs 2100, which involved writing some code and answering a number of questions. usually there is quite a lot to write but each questions was only worth 1/2 marks. thankfully, this could be done in pairs. the grading is somewhat slow, since we only received our lab 3 and 4 feedback after finals was

digresses a lot and provided a lot of info that is not needed for the course (i do appreciate the extra knowledge but it is just too much and takes up too much time). it is also clear that he do little preparation, if any, before coming to lecture, evidently by him copy-pasting the lecture slides from previous semesters and keep saying ""i don't know what going on here"" whenever he encounter a funny slides made by the previous lecturers (how hard is it to simply remove those slides before coming to lecture?)tutorial: my tutorial ta was actually quite good. however, some of the tutorial questions are quite vague and have implicit assumption that is only know by the person who set it (who is not teaching the course anymore).lab: my ta was horrible. he always came around 15 minutes

the 1 st).2% from tutorial attendance (allowed to verify just before course ends).labs (25%)labs were more or less biweekly, based on the current lecture topics. lab 1 was a c refresher and labs 2-4 were on bash/ipc, synchronisation (semaphores), and memory allocation (bitmap & linkedlist) respectively.the labs were honestly not as scary/time-consuming as the other reviews made them out to be (albeit the last lab on memory management required some help from a certain intelligent assistant....). they take a bit of tinkering for sure but the test cases should be passable in reasonable time and the accompanying lab reports consist mostly of google-able 1 m/2 m questions. just allocate enough time before the lab demo for debugging and in case the remote unix server (stu/xlog) on which test cases are run has capacity issues.midterm (20%)1 hr closed-book (1 double-sided a 4 cheatsheet allowed) paper worth 40 marks consisting of 20 x 2 m mcqs on the first 5 topics of the course. time management was a bit of an issue for me, but the bigger drama was surrounding the grading of the midterm. many questions were fairly ambiguous, and this combined with arithmetic errors in the official answers led to multiple regrades of the midterm that lasted until week 12/13. additionally, a few questions (particularly 1 on function definitions involving posix threads) may frustrate students who didn't happen to put the relevant info on their cheatsheet.that being said the midterm to me was not itself particularly very difficult or frustrating so if you have the patience to wait for administrative errors to be resolved and you can accept the limitations of your cheatsheet, then its pretty much a straightforward component.final (50%)2 hr closed-book (1 double-sided a 4 cheatsheet allowed) paper worth 80 marks consisting of 10 x 2 m mcqs and 60 m worth of open-ended questions on interleaving, memory, semaphores, and the ext 2 file system.the final was fairly straightforward as well, with an interleaving question straight from tutorial, a semaphores question 90% similar to lab, and a memory question with a very similar template to pyps. there was also more than enough time to do the paper and review it. the catch was that some of the mcqs may be tricky, and most of the answers to the memory questions were single numbers which can be scary since there was no guarantee of partial marks. i just wrote as much working whenever possible to show my thought process. similarly for the semaphores question there was no mention of how syntax errors would be treated so it was mostly estimating as close an answer as possible when handwriting code.overall thoughtsquite an interesting course since it covers a fundamental area of computing. despite being a systems course, it was still a mostly theoretical, high-level overview of how computers abstract and synchronise processes, memory and files in the form of a complex api (the kernel) between applications and the lowest-level devices. i felt quite engaged throughout and although the labs were frustrating at times (c is seriously not it.....), i would say the course was well-administered. profs colin and nitya have different teaching styles (colin is more hyperactive and storyteller-like while nitya is more straightforward to the slides), but they were both clearly comfortable with the subject-matter.if you are traumatised from the million calculations and the boring microscopics of cs 2100, don't fear that from cs 2106. it is much more welcoming as a subject and not nearly as low-level or

mistake to spend so much time on that... pick up all the low-lying fruits first.content difficulty: 8/10 one of the tougher introductory module. however, once you get parts of it, the same idea can be reflected throughout. for example, memory management techniques can also be used on file management, so once you understand one, the other is almost the same.through this module, you will gain a lot of insights into what your os is doing while you are surfing the web with your online zoom lecture at the side. basically things like kernel vs user, processes (context switching, storing of processes in ram), virtual memory, resources allocation and management, and secondary storage (file system). on top of that, you will experience some parts of concurrent programming. real fun stuff.workload: 8/10 if you have no experience in c programming, good luck. c being a low level programming language forces you to deal with a lot of weird constraints that are abstracted away in other languages. you will have to deal with your own memory allocation, signal handling and system calling.you will also have to devise some way to synchronise concurrent threads/processes, which is very difficult to come out with a solution quickly. all the labs will take some time to do, try to do them with a friend (if they still allow this), 2 brains are better than 1 (or maybe your brain is better than mine, then can go solo).usefulness: 8/10 this should be basic knowledge for all programmers out there. while the os may handle these load balancing and management for you, i think it is still useful to know what is going on. furthermore, being able to write concurrent programs is quite important. as my internship interviewer once said ""why use 1 core when you have 4"", while he is explaining to me the importance of concurrency in the current age of technology. inspiring words to live by as a programmer.experience: 8/1010/10 mental torture trying to synchronise processes. you can feel your brain

handling, threads, synchronisation, memory management and file systems were covered. the deep dives this module provided with regards to the lower level implementations of the computer were indeed valuable.lectures were held in person and recorded, but i headed down for all the physical lectures anyway. i would think prof wong is an interesting person to hang out with, but i could not help but zone out perhaps due to how he delivered his lectures. uncle soo taught the module a few years ago and put his set of lecture videos on panopto, which i learnt more from.there were weekly pop quizzes to make sure we understood what happens during the lectures, which were quite helpful though sometimes stressful since they had to be submitted one day after each lecture.tutorials were held every week for an hour each, just like most level 2000 cs modules. my tutor explained concepts clearly and was able to answer some tricky questions our class had with relative ease, while also preparing consultations after week 13.lab sessions were once a week online; you could even skip them unless you needed to present the first part of the lab to your lab tutor. there were a total of four labs where i had to play around with linked lists, process creation, synchronisation using semaphores and file operations. c isn't too far away from the silicon, debugging was way too difficult, and the quirks and peculiarities of the language were left for the students to be found out on our own.the process of thinking, coding and debugging was almost enjoyable in the end when all things were considered. writing c got me to think close to the silicon, reinforcing my theoretical understanding of the content covered.midterms and finals were theory based, consisting of both mcq and short answer questions. some of the mcqs for the midterms were rather tricky, and required a fair bit of out of the box thinking. thankfully the finals might have pulled my grades up a little.i have to say that however difficult and cryptic operating systems is as a topic, i enjoyed the ideas under the hood, and how it relates to the programming tasks most of us do. some jobs also require a familiarity with c. unfortunately, this module is compulsory for cs students, but i really think a good understanding of the low-level concepts, as well as parallel programming, would make one's appreciation of

2100. the vibe is quite similar, in that there is a lot of content, but everything is quite straightforward and simplified from how things work in the actual system.one thing i heard is that the labs this sem were harder than last sem (ay 21/22 s 2). admittedly, i did spend a non-trivial amount of time on them. they were very fun though. lab slots on nusmods don't reflect the actual situation. you only need to attend lab on the week they release a new lab assignment. there are 4 labs in total so you only attend lab 4 times in the whole sem. so, the lab timeslot is actually non-existent most of the time. you just have to submit your lab before the deadline. i also skipped tutorials completely (5% participation), and i think the answers provided were sufficient in my learning.exam is open book, so memorization is not needed.massive tip right here: take this with cs 3210 if you can and are already planning on taking that mod. there is some overlap of topics and it really helps (and it shows), especially on topics related to processes, threads and synchronization. additionally, the little book on semaphores is an especially useful book for synchronization problems. i recommend keeping it as a reference even if you don't plan on reading it.overall, useful mod and you can think of the workload to be similar to cs 2100, except that the labs are not trivial like the ones in cs

tutor was uncle soo himself. he adopted a round-robin format, and made everyone in class take turns to answer tutorial questions. this was good because it forced people to think and do their tutorials

""but that's the case for every mod!"" not really, because those things are not the focus of 99% of the semester's content. it's also very much down to luck, as you never know which chosen model design is the best one, at what point it'll overfit, or whether the restrictive test cases accurately reflect the strength of your model.i would've much preferred the introductory cs 2109 s to be foundational and theoretical, including its assessments, rather than being decided by a wild 28-hour war at the end. but keep in mind that this is coming from the perspective of someone who hates code.see more 100 replyshare ›−+ssoupsoupa year agofinal grade: asee more 00 replyshare ›show more repliesshow more replies −+ssoupsoupa year agofinal grade: asee more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ian hong yi en 3 years agoeditedtaken in ay 21/22 sem 2, first ever run of this module, ""we're building this plane as we fly it""dropped in week 6, received w grade.lecturer: prof ben leong, though his specialisation is not in ai or mllanguage: pythonassessment- coursemology- midterms and finals- closed-book with 1 cheatsheet. prof likes making students make cheatsheets.workload- worse than 2040 s.

ay 23/24 sem 1 lecturer: rizkii think there have been enough criticitisms about this course. if there is a single course which you should avoid as much as possible, it is this one. for those of you who are taking a 2 nd major in cs and thinking of using this course to replace your common core modules (e.g. hs 1501), my suggestion is to take your common core instead because at least those courses are s/u-able.to me, the most ridiculous part of this course is thatnearly 2/3 of the entire syllabus is not tested.sure, you can argue that the machine learning knowledge is ""tested"" in the final by letting you implement that model, but honestly, let us all admit that you can easily reach the median or upper quartile as long as you know how to smartly do google-oriented programming.the confusing thing in the course structure is that,while claiming that all theories and mathematical contents are not tested, the lecturers still choose to focus overwhelmingly on the theoretical aspects with an absurd level of ignorance on practical skills. every single problem set to me felt like something that i did not learn at all from past lectures, and i have to self-learn all the things from scratch in order to complete it - i mean, what is the point of having this kind of exercises as homework if the techniques used are not taught at all? not to mention the fact that a course with such a strong focus on practical component does not even has a weekly lab session - this means that if you have prior knowledge in implementing machine learning models, you can basically secure the final exam without actually knowing any theory at all.on the other hand, while dr rizki chose to talk about the theory and not the practical during his lectures, he also chose to skip most of the rigorous reasonings behind all theory taught. the so-called ""mathematics"" he taught during lectures is basically a display of formulae that comes out of nowhere, and he didn't even bother to explain even if you ask him because - quote - ""this is very advanced so i fear most of you wouldn't understand"" (sure, if you call level 3000 applied maths ""very advanced""). so, in short, i don't really understand what they want to teach in this course in the first place - neither the theory nor the practical skills was properly taught and practised.the final was a mess as expected. i spent almost 20 hours on the model until i finally gave up, simply because there are some people with quite advanced practical experience with implementing machine learning and it's nearly impossible to beat them in the bell curve by using what we are able to practise in this course. additionally, i really don't get the rationale behind starting the exam at 8 pm and put the deadline at 2359 the following day. when some students complained, the solution proposed by dr rizki was: sure i can start the exam at the morning, but it will be the morning of the second day, so that means all of you will have much less time to complete the final contest. however, i don't see the reason why the contest can't just start at 8 am and be due at 12 noon the next day. nevertheless, this is another piece of evidence

semester where they think it is a good idea to get rid of the 24-hour hackathon assignment and resort to using examplify for both midterm and final.long story short: this course is utter nonsense.for midterm, most of the questions are in mcq, mrq, tf, fitb. this is fine, except that they expect you to draw a bunch of game trees, decision trees, alpha-beta pruning. most people i know started from the back to finish these questions first, as these questions have clear answers. problem is for the earlier questions, they thought it is a good idea to make the choices a bunch of non-standard mathematical notations that made the questions ambiguous. also, man decided to write sci-fi for the earlier questions resulting in a total wipeout. the statistics is clear,median for this midterm is 52% - 53%.as if this isn't enough, they decided to change the final format to using examplify as well, probably because in previous semesters when they had take-home finals, most people could use chatgpt to cheat and get a decent score. for finals, there is only one pyp and nothing else, making it almost impossible practice. man skipped all the math during lecture in the later chapters, but expect us to understand the math during exam. sure, i have no problem with that. problem is during finals, a lot of the questions involved does not state the loss functions, activation functions, etc, which could lead to ambiguity again, as if this is not an examplify exam!!! do they know how these things work?another component is we had to make an agent for competing against others on the connect 4 game. this is quite fun, probably the only good thing about the course.anyway, this course taught me nothing. glad that it ended and it successfully ruined my interest in the field of ai/ml.see more

some part of your model and don't know why your model is performing poorly (since everything is black boxed)? well good luck, as the implementation part is worth 28% of your overall grade and can easily jeopardise your grade. while this could also be said for some finals that do not give partial credit, at least the weightage is nowhere close to 28%! also, it being held on sunday just doesn't feel right - it feels illegal.to this course's credit, the ai portion is taught pretty well, where there are visualisations and proper explanations of the search algorithms and decision trees. unfortunately, this is nowhere near enough to make up for the ml portion of this course. perhaps this course should be named ""introduction to ai"", with more emphasis on ai.to future students, please take cs 3243 + cs 3244 if you want to avoid this mess of a module. yes, it is a grad requirement, but you can always take cs 3243 + cs 3244, even as a cs student. edit: this can be done as cs students

module. as of ay 2021/22 intake, this module has become one of the nine fundamental programme requirements for a cs major, despite being a relatively “new” module. i took this module partly out of interest but mostly because it’s a requirement. as the second iteration of the module, i do not think that in its current state it should be set as a core module for cs majors as there are unfortunately many issues regarding content and grading. good understanding of calculus, linear algebra and basic algorithms are required for this module.the classes cover the very basics of classical and modern ai and ml but presented in a way that is extremely unpolished. many of the slides are snippets of mathematical equations so it is essential for you to have a good knowledge of how to decipher these notations into english when you work on problems because that’s how the questions are set. they give you a complex mathematical equation as a problem as ask you to code a solution, in a language you’ve just picked up 3 months ago. 3 rd party videos were helpful in understanding the concepts but the main issue was the delivery of questions for the coursework and examinations.the midterms was alright, there were mostly unrefined questions that tested you on lecture content, provided that you actually understood the content in the way that it was delivered. the real nightmare was the last minute 30% practical final exam which really threw everyone off. i personally felt like i was the dumbest individual in the course because i couldn’t understand what the questions were asking for, even though i did pretty okay for the rest of the course. maybe its my own problem with not understanding the mathematical notation enough, but if the problems were presented in english and not in mathematical notation, i wouldn’t have scored 6/60 because i would actually be able to understand what the questions was asking me and code out a solution. in addition, the workload felt like 3 weeks’ worth of assignments crammed into a few hours of final exam. very disappointing.i would suggest avoiding this module at all cost if you’re not taking the specialisation track until it gets polished out.see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+canony 14 years agochanges i am only now seeing between the semesters in preparation for ay 2021/22 y 1 s 2 for boc (hons):the prospective

20 to 16 mcs under the new 6 pillar ge system (so we take 4 ulr modules and have 2 counted from the required cs 1101 s & es 2660), which really helps clarify things.this (cs 2109 s) has been added as a new required 4 mc computer science foundation module. in all, unrestricted elective mcs go up from 32 to 40, still leaving total mcs at 160.i was initially planning on taking cs 3203 software

dropped, greatly alleviating workload issues.30% coursemology (expected for everyone if you put in consistent work for problem sets and turn up for tutorials)35% midterms 35% finalsuntil up to week 4, the explanation provided were very clear and aided in the understanding and mastery of content for the midterms. the time for the midterms paper was very tight and there was way too many questions for me to finish. basically, just practice alpha-beta pruning, decision tree splitting, gain intuition on whether heuristics make sense, and finally, do it all really fast and carefully to score well.after the midterms, i actually had very little theoretical grasp on what was going on. i knew the names and existence of the techniques that were taught, but i pretty much could not do the tutorials at all without handholding. i can't even list down all the content because there is so much content.the final assessment is basically a 28 hour practical exam where you try to train your custom model on an unseen dataset released when the finals begin. there is a week long mock exam for you to prepare yourself, which wasn't very useful this iteration since there was close to no similarity. i had a full battle plan ready to use random forest (really powerful) which worked so well for the mock exam, until it was announced that only neural networks are allowed when the final assessment begun.i really liked the practical and it was very fun. i felt like a detective doing forensic work uncovering all the secrets of data until i could make sense of what it was. the dataset has completely obfuscated column names and labels, so you will not be able to apply domain knowledge. but once you do enough exploratory data analysis, some things stick out to you, and slowly you can piece together clues to figure out the context.with enough exploration, you can then pivot to optimizing your model to the extreme, like finding the best learning rate, the best weight decay, or best batch size. for this semester, we had an image dataset, so you can perform all kinds of image manipulation techniques to make the important features more salient to the neural network. towards the end, it becomes competition of how hard you can pump up your f 1 score by exploiting all the niche characteristics of the dataset and how your model behaves. (stability of f 1 score can be achieved if you correctly select only the relevant features and drop the noise.)perhaps for a module focused on an implementation-heavy final assessment, the lectures and tutorials should also weigh heavier on implementation, such as teaching how to do automated learning rate search, grid search, etc, instead of so much mathematics (gradient descent by hand, proving bce loss function, etc). i benefited from the finals because iabsolutely lovethis form of assessment and having the freedom to write code, but i can acknowledge that people who may not be strong in implementation but are better at theory may not like it as much.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+rrngfailure 2 years agoeditedthe highlight of this module is when coursemo crashed in the last hour of submission and no clear instructions were given by the teaching team, only sudden ""looks like its up plz submit""since the final model (we could only use neural net) is not even deterministic, the strat was to run until you hit a good model f 1-score and just submit since your f 1 score can vary from between below median to 90-100 percentile if you preprocessed well, and you save the stress from being unable to submitsee more 10 replyshare ›−+ssouprngfailure 2 years agothe model gets rerun (re-trained) on their side when they test, so the exact f 1 score on your coursemology run doesn't matter, only your code. don't worry too much about that :dsee more 00 replyshare ›show more repliesshow more replies −+ssouprngfailure 2 years agothe model gets rerun (re-trained) on their side when they test, so the exact f 1 score on your coursemology run doesn't matter, only your code. don't worry too much about that :dsee more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+dderrick khoo 2 years agoeditedtaken in ay 22/23 sem 2 prof: ben leong, rizkiassessment: 10% mini-project, 30% coursemology, 30% midterms, 30% finalsenjoyment: 7.5/10 workload: 8/10 expected grade: a-actual grade: athis is a module that is still going through iterations to make it more stabilised. however, i found the current iteration quite enjoyable.the first 6 weeks of the module was focused on classical ai, while the later 6 weeks of the module were on machine learning. as for the problem sets throughout the 12 weeks, i would say that they are not easy, and not on the level of extremely hard. i took around 5-6 hours on average for the ai problem sets and about 2 hours for the ml problem sets.midterms only covered classical ai and 1 machine learning topic (decision trees), and for the ai part it was focused on formulating the problem and proving(cs 1231 s stuff). a mistake on my end was to spend too much time on the ai part and i had very little time to work on the decision trees question to obtain easier marks.mini project was very time consuming trying to think of ways to improve your agent in the game of breakthrough to score better in the competition, to earn more marks.finals was a highlight of this module, imo. it was a 28 hours ""kaggle style competition"", from 2000 hrs on a saturday to 2359 hrs the next day. for the finals, it definitely is not enough to just rely on knowledge taught during the semester to obtain a relatively good score given the metric (f 1 score for classification problems). for myself, i have to thank doing a decent amount of preparation work for the mock finals released a week before the actual finals so i knew what to look out for during the actual finals. and to quote prof ben ""machine learning is more art than science"", i found this to be exceptionally true for the finals as i found that to obtain a better metric score i was just playing around with the hyperparameters of my ml model and trying to ""guess and check"" to obtain a better metric score.definitely would recommend giving this module a shot now as i feel like it is much better as compared to the reviews given in the past. another important point to note is that the math aspect of this module is significantly reduced, according to the profs. this has probably made this module much ""easier"" and more understandable.see more 10 replyshare ›−+jjamesderrick khoo 2 years agoeditedhi, can i check how hard it is to get a b+? i am worried of taking this mod as i am not strong at programming like you.

up dropping the module as no one realised that the undergraduate office forgot to say that cs 2040 s was a prerequisite. this was the second iteration of the module, and there were unfortunately a great deal of rough edges to be fixed in future semesters. the actual prerequisites for the module are cs 2040 s, ma 1521 and cs 1231 s, but a good understanding of linear algebra is essential.the department decided to make this module compulsory for all cs majors admitted from ay 2021/22 onwards, while removing cs 2105 (computer networks) as a graduation requirement. i am not sure what the department is thinking, but i believe prof ben is also thinking the same way since he keeps saying ""due to the infinite wisdom of the department"".the class covers more or less the basic topics in ai and machine learning, starting with a refresher on breadth-first and depth-first search, continuing to a* and local search, then to machine learning where regression, classification, neural networks and unsupervised learning were all taught. about 30% of the module was on classical ai, while the rest was on machine learning where there was a lot of mathematics involved.lectures were conducted by prof ben which were quite underwhelming, but that could be because he works with software engineering, not machine learning. i remember going down for one of his lectures, thinking that i understood quite a fair bit after the lecture, but ended up throwing everything away in just one day. thankfully there were other materials on youtube and elsewhere which cleared up some of my doubts.tutorials were conducted weekly for an hour each, where we went through the usual tutorial worksheets. these were a good help to complement what was learnt in lecture, but i couldn't help doing other work during the tutorial since the finals was a practical exam, and the tutorials were theory based. my tutor was very willing to help with my queries and had the patience to type out long form answers to relatively simple questions, so that i could understand the concepts more fully.there were a grand total of 8 problem sets which were done on jupyter notebook and submitted on coursemology, which would be familiar to most readers. problem set 0 was unceremoniously released on the monday of the first week of school, to make life more difficult for us. these were considerably frustrating to complete, partly due to logistical issues. jupyter notebook did not have any debugging functionality, and somethimes a bug triggered seemingly from nowhere would fill up my entire hard disk with an error log if i was particularly unlucky that day. i found pycharm much more useful due to the powerful debugger, but i could not figure out how to use it for the last few problem sets. additionally, coursemology would report my correct answers to be wrong sometimes, and fixing it took me a few consultations with the ta.the mini-project was released in week 4 and due in week 8, but students were advised to work on it during recess week. we had to code an ai to play the game of breakthrough on a 6 by 6 board, and our ais were pit against one another where the winner would gain some xp on coursemology. the task appeared to be quite simple as i only had to implement alpha-beta pruning, but the implementation was much harder to debug than i had expected.the midterms were a 2 hour long theory paper which i performed to my expectations. right after we were released, the answers for the exam were placed on coursemology, so some of us must have checked their answer to great dismay. it was a bit strange to see things like a* search and decision trees tested in the midterms, but never again.the finals, the first time it was held as a practical exam, was conducted in the computer labs where we had to implement breadth-first search, as well as some functions with numpy to perform classification and regression. we were unable to search stackoverflow, which made things quite tricky. the questions were much harder than expected, since the tas overestimated the students' skill level, and the only machine learning questions i could finish were those that were copied verbatim from the mock exam. thankfully, most people looked quite shell-shocked by the end of it all.i believe that most cs students do not like the module, but it is after all a work in progress and i need not be too scathing. another instructor may take over after one or two semesters. perhaps the ai part of the module does not seem too relevant since it is just the graphs part of cs 2040 s with extra steps, but the basics of machine learning could be a useful start if you would like to do more machine learning. if this module is not compulsory, cs 3243 or cs 3244 could be an option since i have heard good things about prof kan who teaches cs 3244 in semester 1.see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+jotham wong 3 years agotaken in ay 22/23 sem 1, second iteration of the module.lecturer: prof

""introductory"". the course excludes most of the math part of ai and ml.for most topics, especially those related to support vector machines (svm) and neural networks, this course focuses on “how” the technique works without explaining “why” it works or “why” the technique is designed in such a way.as a result, it is easy for me to design a simple ai agent, but it is hard to explain it.about the miniprojectthe miniproject requires us to design an agent for a game in about 4 weeks. for us, the game is ultimate tic-tac-toe. our agents are tested against some test bots. the grade is determined by the result of the games. in general, the miniproject is not hard. but the timing is very awkward. this project context works well with the convolutional neural network. however, the convolutional neural network is only taught in week 11, and the project is due in week 12. i feel that i don’t have enough time to digest the knowledge and use it in the project.

1 and 2 working under rizki, conghui, patrick and eric (semester 1 only).this is a ta review for those who may be interested in teaching.as a part time ta, you can choose to do the following:teach in tutorials and mark coursemology problem sets. typically, you are assigned 1 tutorial group to teach and grade problem set submissions in the same tutorial group. if you are not interested in teaching, you can take over grading submissions of the tutorial groups that are being taught by the profs. for tutorial preparation, the question and answer key should be given around a few days before the first tutorial so you have some time to prepare your slides. you are also provided with a starter pack of rizki’s slides from past semesters so if you are lost/lazy you can build from there. the amount of claimable hours for this portion is 10 (teaching) + 40 (grading) per tutorial class.prepare tutorials/lecture trainings/problem sets. as we build these components iteratively from last semester (probably because the teaching team is mostly the same post ben leong era), you are most likely to implement changes based on feedback from last semester, which may or may not involve coming up with new questions from the top of your head. specifically for tutorials, you are to present a recap on things to keep note of and things you changed from the previous iteration to all the other tas in weekly meetings. the amount of claimable hours for this portion is 20 per tutorial/problem set/ all lecture trainings.do mini project stuff. i’m not sure how much work is done during the semester since i’ve heard this setup has been starting before the semester even started. however, a lot of hours definitely have to be put in to this as you have to code the game and prepare skeletal code for the students, and create the agents for the students to benchmark against. i do not know how much you can claim for this but i assume it’s a lot.as a person who sucks at interviews (i once applied to be a 1231 s tutor but failed due to skill issue), i was offered this opportunity because i got an a when i last taken this course. for both semesters, i only took 1 class to teach + grade assignments. i also decided that using rizki’s slides was a smart move since my design skills were not that good in the first place anyway. i particularly struggled with preparing the second half of the tutorials because the semester i took this course was the last semester that they had the 28 hour take home practical exam, which means you didn’t have to know the deep theory of machine learning to do well in this course. however, since i have to teach, and they introduced finals that semester, i had to book up very quickly. teaching svm in particular was a trainwreck and i will not further elaborate (they made it simpler the next semester). i was fortunate enough to have a good number of students that are participative to some extent, despite having to come over at 9 am which to those who live off campus i believe is very early. my teaching score for this semester is 4.6/5.for the second semester, we had some changes in the order of topics, and limited the scope of svm (thank god). we also had changes to the first tutorial which we had to give a video tutorial on. funnily enough, there were a group of tutors that uploaded their video, but used material from the previous semester. another incident that happened was that the ta of the class before mine forgot to find a replacement, which left a class of unassuming students in the tutorial room with no one in front. i tried to salvage the situation but the projector also broke down that day so i was left flustered having no idea what to do. overall, i was particularly dissatisfied in myself because i underestimated the time i needed to spend being familiar with the material again, given that i have taught these exact concepts again. this batch of students were also less passionate compared to last semester but maybe it’s because i’m not good enough to get their attention.for grading assignments, the rubrics given are quite easy to follow, and students typically don’t submit code that partially passes test cases due to the decreased difficulty of problem sets over the semesters.in terms of pay to work ratio, i think this is a good course to teach. however, please don’t sign up for teaching this course just to get paid.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+jjayden 27225 months agofound this mod review online and felt it was very helpful!https://the-education.vercel.app/module-reviews/cs 2109

the game state and actual implementation) using any ai/ml techniquesboth in and out of course. the bot was played as both player 1 and 2 against peers' agents (2 rounds per match).the course-provided agents (at least the 2 non-hidden ones) were supposedly designed to be easy to beat. for me, i needed at least some semblance of strategy specific to connect 4 instead of just using vanilla negamax.to do well in the contest, more advanced enhancements not taught in the course were required such as transposition tables, bitboards, lookup tables, etc. supposedly the top scorer did not even use ml in his agent but an external search algorithm (monte carlo tree search) which is frequently used for games. nevertheless, a free dataset is available by kaggle and uci providing connect 4 win/lose data if it might be useful to judge the utility of different board states.overall 5-number summary (%/10): 0, 5.65, 6.84, 7.66, 9.98 coursemology (30%)5 compulsory and 2 optional problem sets this semester. only one problem set was officially optional which was the first (ps 0) on introduction to python/matrices/numpy. the 2 nd one was optional for those who had already capped at 30% (which is easy due to heavy contributions from psets and tutorials + new in-lecture participation), which was the last one (ps 5) on unsupervised learning.the remaining problem sets from uninformed search to recurrent neural networks were more-or-less compulsory. i spent roughly 2-4 hours on each problem set. they were quite handheld and although some bugs were frustrating, these were figured out eventually with some tinkering/ta help.pretty much everyone in the cohort got 30% (or very close to it) except for some edge cases.midterm (30%)1.5 hr examplify paper worth 80 marks comprising ~50 mcqs/mrqs/fibs. scope was uninformed/informed/local/adversarial search and decision trees. time was quite tight, and so most people committed to the optimal strategy of starting from the back to secure free marks from minimax/ab-pruning/decision trees because they involved 1 straight way of answering while search/heuristics has historically always been a fickle subject with many questions basically amounting to guesses. i hope they fix this eventually because they can't seem to find a good way to test search/heuristics in a nontrivial manner, but i suppose it is what it is.5-number summary (%/30): 5.85/13.8/15.975/18/26.55 final (30%)2 hr examplify paper worth 90 marks comprising 39 mcq/mrq/fibs (the instructors clearly accepted the time-issues from midterm which was nice). there were 2 questions from the 1 st half (a* search, ab-pruning), and the rest from the 2 nd half. since this was the first semester for this final format, no-one including the tas had any idea what was expected. the general sentiment was that unlike previous semesters, all the linear algebra and calculus for ml would actually be relevant. however, the final ended up being more of a ""did you pay attention for lecture/tutorial/coursework""-check, and had mostly conceptual questions with pre-u algebra at best. however, there were challenges of ambiguity for several questions (for both midterm and final) of which some were conceded by the instructors, and some not. since the exam was closed-book, it would be to your disadvantage if you left out some useful facts from the course that featured in the exam. moreover, as with most mcq/mrq/fib papers, careless mistakes were more expensive (which partially explains my overall % below), since in the absence of working there is almost no room for benefit-of-doubt other than the goodwill of examiners.i still prefer this to the 28-hour final of previous semesters, though. the 28-hour final demanded close to 1.5 days in the weekend before finals week (especially since it releases at 8 pm saturday, so good luck to any remaining energy you may have on sunday to study for your other finals). moreover, competition was quite insane (read reviews below), and i felt its more likely for average students doing the course alone (i.e. no friends or chatgpt-4 o to collude with) to end-up on the bad side of the curve.5-number summary (%/30): 7.5/17.364/19.8/22.05/27.6 overall thoughtsi honestly did not expect much from this course because of its reputation (tedious psets, annoying midterm, stressful final, etc). in the end i think this was quite a decent introduction to the basics of ai/ml to those like me who knew nothing about it before. i found ml to be especially interesting and cool; finally gaining some understanding of how artificial agents are trained to output the right answers to complicated questions. plus, the underlying calculus and algebra was quite cool to me - my favorite example is the picture below of support vector machines). in fact, i gained the curiosity to check out cs 3264 and cs 4248 (which i had no intention of taking before).viewhidei'm sure they will continue improving this course in the

lecturing style can be slightly casual. module is structured similar to cs 2040 s with lecture training, problems sets etc.first half of the module is on classical ai. theres some revision on cs 2040 s topics and introduction of new search techniques. personally found these problems sets harder as i wasn't very good at cs 2040 s.midterms is closed book with one double-sided cheatsheet. topics included classical ai, decision trees, alpha beta pruning. decision trees and alpha beta pruning are easy marks but can take very long if not familiar with applying the algo. timing is tight.mini project required implementing an agent with alpha beta pruning to play a game. i was rushing other module so my agent was a vanilla alpha beta implementation and it got ard median mark.finals was a kaggle style competition, sat 8 pm to sun 2359, the weekend right before finals week. we are given a dataset consisting of tabular data and image data and had to perform classification.slightly skeptical if the finals is a good test of the content taught in the module as the best models currently for classifying tabular data are tree-based models which are not covered in the module and can perform better than the relatively simpler models covered during lectures. chatgpt was explicitly allowed for finals.may have heard during one of the lectures that riski will be taking over the module

implementing algorithms shown in lectures. personally, i took around 3-4 hours each problem set.midterms only covered the first half of the module, which consisted of classical ai (uninformed search, informed search, etc.) and some machine learning topics (decision tree classification). the proving questions were much shorter (and harder) but gave more marks compared to the easier but time-consuming questions. i didn't really study the ai topics and skipped most proving questions, got slightly below median because of that.mini project was the highlight of the module. we had to implement an ai to play breakthrough. we had to beat 2 ai agents that the teaching team set to secure a b. from that point onwards, the extra marks depended on our winrate against fellow students who beat the 2 ai agents.finals was a very cool experience too. we had 28 hours over the weekend to implement a classification model. you probably have to utilize most stuff you learnt in the ml problem sets to score a decent grade. once again, our grades are directly based on our model's f 1 score on hidden test data vs the entire cohort.overall, this was a very fun and practical module where you can get by even if you suck at math like me as long as you understand what the math is used for. iirc, prof ben mentioned that another lecturer would be taking over him the next semester. would

with some metrics described online will bring you quite far. debugging may take a good amount of time.midterms - 2 hour paper, format has been well defined from previous years paper. usually involved setting up a description of a problem and formulating local search solution for q 1. subsequent questions on pruning and decision trees. the question on decision tree took up a significant amount of time in computation, which was acknowledged as a problem by the teaching team.midterms did feel hard but i equally did not perform very well personally, got about median.finals - 2 hour practical exam. question 1 was coding out a  local search solution. questions 2 and 3 both was the use on numpy to implement various mathematical functions and run ml.good part is that in the exam prep, a ""receipe"" to solve various forms of question 1 was provided. some practice should allow you to solve q 1 in around 30 mins.q 2 and q 3 was pretty much a free for all as a very good understanding of numpy was needed to solve most of the questions within 1.5 hours without external help. i left a good portion of these questions blanks. the exam prep was of limited help here. i did a good bit better than median.overall can see the improvments in the module and believe it will get better moving forward. i won't be pursing a specialisation in ai so this is the end of ai modules for me. still unsure

CS3230,"This course introduces different techniques of designing and analysing algorithms. Students will learn about the framework for algorithm analysis, for example, lower bound arguments, average case analysis, and the theory of NP-completeness. In addition, students are exposed to various algorithm design paradigms. The course serves two purposes: to improve the students' ability to design algorithms in different areas, and to prepare students for the study of more advanced algorithms. The course covers lower and upper bounds, recurrences, basic algorithm paradigms (such as prune-and-search, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, graph traversal, and randomised approaches), amortized analysis, NP-completeness, and some selected advanced topics."," −+luna 2 years agoeditedcs 3230: design and analysis of algorithmsay 2023/2024 semester 1 lecturer: rahul jain, arnab bhattacharyyaassessment:20% midterm 40% finals 20% weekly assignments 10% tutorial participation 10% 2 programming assignmentslectures are in-person and streamed online, recorded.tutorials are once a week, and skippable. you only need to present your answer to a weekly assignment about once to get the full participation.programming assignments are like competitive programming questions, to be submitted to an online judge (codecrunch) and full marks are awarded if you pass all the test cases.midterms and finals are held in person, with pen and paper, open-book.syllabus:stable matchingalgorithm analysisgraphsgreedydivide and conquerdynamic programmingmax flow min cutintractibilitynp completenessapproximationlocal searchrandomizedpersonal thoughts:one of the worst cs courses i've ever taken, not even because of the content.the content is really fine, it will be the most mathematical rigour you will see if you don't plan to take anything too rigorous as a graduation requirement.this course doesn't even have as much mathematical rigour as you think anyway. it's just an example dump of algorithms, more like a primer of what exists in the world.it is hard to understate how bad this course is, to summarise in a single statement, this is essentially a self-studying course.the professor is unresponsive to e-mails, making the head ta release their own solutions ""unofficially"" through telegram, so we have feedback.the lecture slides are ripped directly from a website online, and are completely untailored to the teaching. the slides are often too long compared to the timeslot, and are handwaved away to ""read in your own free time"". most of the lecture is examples after examples.here are the said lecture slides:https://www.cs.princeton.ed...the lecture slides often do not have any value added. not much is gained from watching the lecture.the lecture recordings are haphazard. during the first few weeks, recordings were lost unapologetically. if not for a student's unofficial recording, they would be lost.there is little mathematical rigour. we did not learn master's theorem, not small-o and small-omega notation, just examples of applications of the algorithm of the week.the sample exam papers are asking for the mass of the sun. given the lack of rigour, the sample exam papers often feel completely impossible and shouldn't even be given to us.the weekly assignments, to be gone through in tutorial, are not marked timely. for example, as of week 11, only problem sets 1 and 2 are marked and released. there is no feedback for our answers and proof methods.the exam marking style is not great. by enforcing an all-or-nothing system, no differentiation is made. a student that is a little bit off from the real answer (but nonetheless wrong) is awarded exactly equal marks to a student who has no clue what is going on in the question. this is evident from the extremely close marks of the median and upper quartile. (27 and 31)in summary, i don't know what they want from me.without any intervention from the head ta, this course is in shambles. i don't feel my time as a student being respected, throwing all of my submissions into a black hole. i am not getting any feedback.message to others:if you're strong in algorithms or learning is not a concern, by all means, take this course. if you rely on the course

like the professors are not able to cover all the contents in time and this is made very apparent when we are tested (both finals and midterms) on content that has yet to be covered in tutorial.as mentioned in other comments, the lecture slides were taken from some other university. i felt that prof arnab was fine in terms of his explanations, but prof rahul skipped a lot of important details. imagine seeing this crazy math formula, he goes okay step 1, 2 and now 10. he seems to assume we have a lot of prior math knowledge and thus, skipped explaining important portions of the formulas. the lecture slides, being lecture slides are meant to be in point form. thus, it was next to useless without any prior context or additional elaboration.any 2 hour lecture easily became a 7-8 hours lecture of trying to decipher what he was saying. it got to the point where after his second lecture, i forgo watching the recordings entirely and just read textbook + youtube + chatgpt.for people who want to read the textbook, do start early. each chapter is easily over 30-50 pages and it can take a while to understand what is going on.for weekly assignments, half of my submissions have yet to be

tutorial participation 10% 2 programming assignmentsprobably the worst computer science course i've taken in my two years at nus. part of it is a skill issue on my part, and part of it is the sheer lack of effort on the professors' part. lectures are held once a week, and recorded as well. recordings tend to be of poor quality. it tends to be quite hard to follow the professors when they cover mathematical proofs, especially the more rigorous ones. the slides (as slides are designed to be) don't cover every single step of the proofs, and the professors don't elaborate either, so we have no source to refer to except the extremely verbose 900-page textbook (which also doesn't explain proofs in full sometimes).tutorials were alright. i skipped a few when the second half of the semester became hectic, but my ta teaches really well and would grade psets in a timely manner as well. from what i heard, many other tas were quite slow in grading and this made it difficult for people to prepare as well, or to know where their understanding has some gaps. programming assignments were very challenging, but they give plenty of time and hints towards the deadline as well.the midterm was painfully bad. i went in feeling unprepared and i feel like while the professors cover examples in lectures, they don't teach us how to approach such paradigms. i suppose at a higher level 3 k module, they assume we can figure it out, but i struggled a fair amount and made silly mistakes even in the topics i knew well, simply because i was not very confident. someone commented below that questions are graded as all-or-nothing, but that isn't true. i do know people (myself included) that received partial marks for some subquestions, although admittedly it was quite rare to receive partial marks. most of my subquestions were either full or zero.finals was crazy lol, nothing else i can say about that. i have no idea whether any of my answers made sense or not. here's to the bell-curve god (who

i’m probably biased towards this type of mod but can see why this mod has a reputation for being hard. it’s practically a math mod.the first half of the module is kind of a repeat of cs 2040 s but with much more mathematical rigor. especially with hashing, where there was an entire lecture dedicated to hashing algorithms. the last few topics of the mod were very spicy and interesting for me. it took me a bit of time to understand rigorously what it means for a problem to be in np, but afterwards it was interesting seeing how to prove that a problem was in np and finding out that a huge pool of problems all have the same “difficulty” (np-complete) by reducing them from one to another all over the place.the tutorials for this module are surprisingly short and straightforward. we would often finish in 40 minutes or less. most of the practice you would get for the exams come from pyps and the homeworks. there is a weekly homework with 3 items to do, of which 10 are graded on effort and 3 are graded on correctness. most can be done in a few hours, and the workload comes more from how much effort you want to put into writing/typing your proofs. i personally put in a bit more effort to make sure that i could fully secure the 20% ca component. the admin side of things here were a bit iffy with our homework grades and feedbacks coming very late and tutorial questions being released after some of the tutorial classes for the week were already done, but nothing major happened.both the midterms and finals were out of 40 marks. the midterm consisted of 4 items each worth 10 points. each item had a few sub items under them so you could farm some partial marks. q 1 and q 4 were doable while q 2 kinda felt like an online assessment item and q 3 was some hashing item. the 4 number summary was 0/11/18/24/40, which goes to show how brutal the midterms were. the finals had a few short items in front like q 1 of the midterm followed by some longer ones similar to the rest of the midterms. but then this time, it was essentially a handheld walkthrough of the solution since it was broken up into so many 1-3 pt items that it essentially became an issue of whether you can speedrun figuring out and writing the logic of each step fast enough. this made the finals noticeably easier than the midterms, although it was longer. scores were also generally higher with the 5 number summary being 0/13.5/20/27/40 this time. also a disclaimer that they are quite strict in grading your proofs for the exams (albeit not to the same degree as cs 1231 s) so make sure you write down enough details and explain clearly. you can also try contesting for more points in an item if you believe you deserve more marks. i know someone who gained quite a number of marks in the finals since they graded an item wrongly.there was also a huge 10% optional component that was actually originally 12%. after some people complained about it, pa 2 got nerfed from 4% to 2%. pa 1 was some difficult codeforces item, while pa 2 was a hashing question. i did discuss the pa with some of my friends a bit and got a bit of help for ideas for the algorithm. pa 1 took a few hours to code out once i got the idea down, while pa 2 was much less implementation heavy. you’re only allowed to use c++ or j*va, and unfortunately i don’t know how to use c++ yet. we were given a pretty big window to do the pas, and i heard more people did pa 1 than the profs expected. i also turned on notifications for the forums of this module only so that i could farm the 4% participation bonus.pre-sem target:

(which are not written by them). but the slides alone are not sufficient to understand the content as the information there is abstract (at least to me it was) and the proofs there skip many steps. both profs are very unprepared, often times appearing lost among the slides themselves. it's obvious they don't even bother to edit the slides/skim through them before lectures. both profs are allergic to annotations, which makes it extremely difficult to follow the lectures. prof rahul loves to stand by the side and do hand motions which are not helpful at all.admin: absolutely ridiculously horrendous. prof arnab doesn't reply to emails (not even to the head ta). hearsay he once arrived at the lecture venue early, but only decided to set up for lecture on the dot, which delayed the start of the lecture. solutions to first half of the problem sets are not released on time (which made the head ta release the solutions in jpeg). the recording of an entire lecture was almost lost but thanks to a student who streamed the lecture on youtube, everyone was able to watch it. midterms were free seating, but we were not told in advance so everyone was lost and prof rahul had to impatiently tell everyone to ""just quickly find a seat and sit down"" (well, if you'd told everyone in advance that it was free seating, we wouldn't be standing around right?). not sure about the other tas, but my ta has only finished marking my problem sets the day before finals. one problem set was not even graded.exams: i find the midterms manageable since some of the content is already covered in other modules like 2040 s. finals however, were nigh impossible to do. it might just be my skill issue, but i feel that the teaching quality is insufficient for us to tackle those

of marking has happened. compare with the midterms with the exact same weightage, where apparently the marking was very standardised. on top of that, the tas have vastly different marking speeds (there was a significant bunch of students which had more than half of their problem sets unmarked after finals were done and returned). mine were returned timely and i thank my ta for the effort they

climb up above my mark post-finals took a toll on my bell-curve-phobic heart and i wouldn't wish it on anyone. both my mids and finals were above 75 th percentile but my overall was knocked down a

was carried out this semester. from the course contents laid out in lecture 0, it seems that we did not even manage to finish covering what was planned.the module was plagued with a host of technical issues from the first lecture. problem sets were also not graded on time. the midterm had no seating plan despite being a course for 300+ students, resulting in massive confusion on exam day and having to take attendence with sheets of foolscap that we write our matriculation number on.i sat in physically for about 7 lectures, hoping that they will get better as the semester moves on. despite this not being the first time the two profs have been handling this module (albeit i think this is the first time both of them are handling it together), time management issues are very apparent in the lecture and we usually did not finish on time.the lecture notes are taken from princeton university algorithm design, and you can find them here:https://www.cs.princeton.ed...the result of this is that the lectures had little transformative content other than reading off the slides and asking ""do you understand?"" or ""any questions?"" eventually, the only role the lecture fulfilled was drawing a very vague boundary of what is examinable.what is or is not examinable is abysmally confusing. because the lecture slides are not done by the profs themselves, sometimes the lecturer will just randomly skip slides and say ""you can read this yourself"". there is no delineation here on what topics will come out in the exam or what are extra content.my biggest appreciation goes out to my tutorial ta, isaiah, who was extremely helpful in answering all my questions on the problem sets and topics. if it wasn't for his tutorial sessions and explanations, i would have understood absolutely nothing for this course. my gratitude also goes out to the head ta yan hao for holding this course together. if it weren't for him, i don't think we would have had any point of communication.this being a core mod and graduation requirement for cs majors, i can only hope this course is better managed in the future.see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+russell saerang 2 years agoay 22/23

lecturers.arnab taught lectures for the first half of the semester. he explains the lectures in a rather moderate pace, and provides additional notes on a separate file. personally, i don't find it useful now, but i believe it's a good reference for sometime later.prashant is much faster than arnab on explaining the lectures. as other reviewers have said, the accent is noticeable, but i found no problem with that. him being fast might be a problem for some students enjoying arnab's pace. it could be also due to the materials being harder but with more content compared to the first half, those taking the module other than me will be the judge.tutorials - 1 hnot compulsory to attend. serves a nice additional question bank i suppose xdthat's all. i don't have much to say about this but i'd like to personally thank wei liang for doing the post-tutorial recap which i found useful!programming assignmentsoptional, but just do it. if you can get the 6%, why not.exams and personal opinionthe midterms were okay despite the cohort scoring relatively low. the finals was easier though.personally, i found the module interesting although some materials might be hard. some questions require an eureka moment to solve but isn't that the fun of doing proof questions.cs 1231 helps you to some extent (read: writing proofs) so i'd suggest you to learn writing one as well. even if you know the idea of solving a question you still have to write it clearly and nicely.expected grade: a-see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+mario lorenzo 5 years agoeditedtaken in ay 19/20 sem 2 (covid semester)lecturer: prof. ken sung and asst prof. diptarka chakrabortygrading scheme: 60% ca (3 assignments (7%, 7%, 20%), 2 programming assigments (7%, 12%), 3% participation, can be covered by 4 optional challenge problems worth 1% each), 20% midterm, 20% finalthis module is a compulsory module for a computer science student, which can be said as the continuation of cs 2040/c/s. the first half of the course breaks down the math behind things that you have learned in cs 2040 equivalents. it covers analyzing complexity (in a more advanced level, with more advanced techniques), divide and conquer algorithm, randomized algorithm, order statistics, etc. while the second half covers new paradigms in solving a problem such as dynamic programming, greedy. it also covers amortized analysis, np-completeness, and finally, approximation algorithms. in my opinion, this is a module where hard work does not help that much. it is very easy for some people who have flair in algorithmic problem solving or have a good mathematical maturity. you can feel that hard work does not help, especially in np-completeness topic, where i feel lost in this module.prof ken is actually a good lecturer, but he is not for everyone. personally, i enjoy the lecture and his humorous style of teaching, but he often skips some mathematical details, which may cause some students to be lost, but he is very enjoyable for people who can adjust to his pace. he is a very senior lecturer, so he knows his content very well. prof diptarka is also a good lecturer, but we did not taught f 2 f by him due to covid-19 situation, so i can't give many comments on him. he responds to queries very fast.the written assignments of this module are very hard for me personally, so i suggest if you don't feel strong at this module, you should start early, and discuss with some friends if you feel helpless and lost. the programming assignments are actually much nicer compared to the written assignments, and i guess it's just a form of coding practice about what is being taught in the class. however, you may lose some points due to incomplete elaboration of your algorithm, so be cautious for it. there are also 4 optional challenge problems to cover some loss of marks. the challenge problems are pretty much difficult and require some time to finish. the midterm was hell, even the first question give a shock already, and it's pretty much impossible to be done within time constraint. the statistics proves it. the final is actually difficult but nicer compared to the midterm. i guess it's because the hard topics such as np-completeness and problem reduction are not included (due to covid-19 situation), yet i feel i screwed up a bit after seeing my result.note: even though i am not a strong student in this module (i still can't solve most problem reduction topics, even after trying several problems), i genuinely enjoy this mod. this mod gives me a very good experience, and provides a stronger mathematical intuition compared to cs 2040 s. sadly, i think this mod is not for everyone, and it is actually hard for most people. not many people enjoy this class and just want to pass the mod. so, i guess ay 19/20 sem 2 batch is lucky to be able to s/u this hahah :p.expected grade: afinal grade: a-see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+aasleepisgoateda year agoediteday 23/24 sem 2

professors are very active (especially on discord), and many tas go out of their ways to help the students as well, particularly the head ta from sem 1 who also taed this sem. the concepts are explained well, and the notes illustrate them adequately too. in addition, the assignments are marked very quickly (almost all within 2 weeks of submission). the midterm was also marked very quickly - we got our script back within a week! it is clear that the coordinators have put a lot of effort into this module, and i don't regret taking the course this semester.cons:however (and you might want to read this carefully if you are very concerned about grades), there seems to be some disparity in the exam difficulty between this year's semester 1 and 2. for reference, here is the mark breakdown of the finals:sem 1: 40 marks, 4 essay questions (10 m each), 2 hours 30 minssem 2: 80 marks, 16 mcqs (40 m) + 4 essay questions (10 m each), 2 hoursthe difficulty of the essay question section was comparable for 23/24 sem 1 and 2 (for instance, proving something was in np was worth 3 m in sem 2, but worth 4 m(!) in sem 1...), which means that with that in mind, the difficulty of the sem 2 paper is approximately twice that of sem 1 (and with less time too). however, do note that the part on the difficulty of the essay questions is just my opinion and there may be people who find the sem 1 questions more difficult (but twice as difficult is quite a stretch...)hence, do weigh carefully which semester you want to take this course in if you are worried about exams!apparently from the horse's mouth, prof halimwill be taking over sem 1 cs 3230 next yearwith prof chang yi-jun, so expect high teaching quality in both semesters (but maybe more time-challenging exams in sem 1?)midterms:

managed and taught the course is. if not for the head ta, the course would be in shambles. the comments made by him are sometimes deadpan or a bit harsh, but he's pretty helpful and i generally agrees with what he says.content: i felt np-completeness was by far the most abstract and hardest topic and we spent the most time on it. but understanding the proofs are quite rewarding. it is the milestone of the course and one of the most important topics in computer science. the first half was more or less recapping 2040(c/s) content, and after np-completeness was going through related topics. it was nice that the profs put the hardest topic a bit earlier so that we have more time to digest the content.tutorials and weekly assignments: the tutorials constantly lagged behind the lectures so materials in the last few lectures were not covered in the tutorials, and yet were still tested in finals. i thought this was a bit unfair. i agree with the head ta's sentiment that it's not a good idea to let us present assignment solutions for class participation, since some presenters don't even seem to know what they are presenting. the assignments are taken from the reference textbook anyways(with solutions online) so anyone can copy the answers. and yet they are still graded for correctness??? hopefully they will never do that again in future.feedback for weekly assignments were also given very slowly, at some point i just gave up waiting for them.midterms: the hardest problem was the last problem on dp and it was basically graded on a all-or-nothing basis. dp wasn't taught properly in the course in my opinion, which made it pretty unfair since cs 2040 s covered it but not the other variants. out of my admittedly small sample, doing cs 2040 s was the deciding factor for whether you could solve it, which makes it quite unfair as well.finals: i felt the questions were somewhat standard. maybe i was lucky, since there were problems some of my mathematically inclined friends were unable to solve. the curve for the midterm was steeper and more packed than previous years so they might have tried to make the finals more differentiating by handholding less.i was fortunate to come into the course with decent background on proof-writing, if not a lot of practice would be needed to do well. nonetheless, i truly hope this course will be better managed in

were very standard. on the other hand, final exam was the true killer of this module where i got literally destroyed by it. i think prof halim decided to kill us for finals because midterm exam was too easy. mcq questions were very tricky, and since i spent ~45 mins on mcqs, i had barely no time for essay questions. fortunately i went through math heavy questions very fast, but i got stuck very hard on algorithm based questions / 1 np completeness question, and they were actually quite difficult to me. in fact, it was difficult for everyone i guess, since the mean was 42/100 which is rediculously low compared to 55/100 average from midterms. one single final exam made my predicted grade decline by 1/2 steps.teaching: prof.diptarka was very clear on explaning contents, which i liked. however, since he went through the lecture contents thoroughly via one or two solid examples, i think theoretical parts of the algorithms were not explained very well. i think professor could go faster on explaining the lecture contents so that more examples or more theoretical parts of the algorithms can be covered and discussed. tutorial questions were mostly standard questions, and they

not agree with me though lol). prof divesh is a very nice and approachable guy, opening up and encouraging students to book consultation slots and being very active and helpful in the forums.however, like what a previous review said, his lectures are about as good as an audiobook version of the textbook (by jeff erickson). watching them is quite a waste of time imo. self learnt the entire module from the textbook, mit lectures on youtube, and jeff erickson's own lectures from his book on his youtube channel (search erick jefferson, these saved my life especially for np). the content tends to be a lot more theoretical and mathematical under divesh than other profs too. there is no coding involved whatsoever. tbh don't feel like np is as hyped up in difficulty as others make it out to be

algorithm. algorithms were to be written in pseudo code, not in any particular language.the assignments are quite challenging, but lots of time is given (it's usually due many weeks after releasing).the tutorials were not released before the tutorial, as we were supposed to do them on the spot when released during the lesson. hence, the tutorial preparation time was effectively 0.lectures are webcasted.the midterm had a very sad average of about 50%. the highest scorer scored full marks, basically about double of the average.the hardest topic in this module is randomised

2023/24 s 2 and prof halim has mentioned that they are planning to standardise the syllabus for both semesters from now on.lectures are recorded although there is a live visualgo quiz every week that contributes a small percentage to the overall ca (40%). while tutorial attendance is not graded, tutorial participation is graded in that for the whole semester, you have to present your solutions for 3 tutorial questions.it is not difficult to get full marks for the ca as the profs want everyone to pass this module. even before finals, 90+% of the cohort had already passed and did not need to retake the module.assignments 5 assignments (2 semi-programming, 3 written), each worth 10% and you are given 2 weeks to complete (starting from week 2). best 4 out of 5, with most people doing the first 4 and skipping the assignment on np-completeness. in this semester, kattis was not used for online submissions. the semi-programming assignments only require pseudocode for the algos but you can submit whatever code you wrote. you can also test its correctness using kattis if the question is publicly available.midterms (20%)midterms was 1 h 40 min long and out of 40 marks, 15 for mcq (1 mark

but if some parts of your answer is wrong then there is no partial marks and you will get 0.due to poor time management, i spent a lot of time on the mcqs which were quite tricky, especially those with 'none of the above' options. i was not sure of my answers at all and relied a lot on elimination and guessing. this left me not much time for the open-ended, but then again the extra time might not have helped much considering i took one glance at the 8 mark randomisation question and instantly decided to leave it blank.finals (40%)finals was 2 h 30 min long and out of 100 marks, 40 for mcq

were really good - sanjay is really energetic (to the point where it can feel like he's shouting at you lol) and diptarka has the strongest indian accent i've ever heard, but both make it work wonderfully. i even started attending some of the live lectures towards the end. halim manages the admin impeccably, and is a top-tier discord moderator to boot. if you ever have any questions you can be sure any of the profs or ta's will answer your questions in no time, and they even have weekly consultations on zoom if you get stuck on the assignments.some tips for the exams: know the contents in the lecture slides well, because the mcqs will test stuff from them. for example, the final had a question requiring us to execute the huffman coding algorithm, which is not something that's otherwise important in the mod. there're also a lot of mcqs on asymptotic analysis and master theorem, stuff that you might forget if you only purely focus on the algorithmic problem solving parts.one minor nitpick: i would prefer if some of the problems in assignments and exams were more ""pure"". for example, i do not need to read a long grandmother story about how applejack is trying to catch the great seedling before implementing what is a (conceptually) relatively straightforward algorithm. while i enjoy reading fiction myself i think these contexts can sometimes obfuscate the important information that's required to solve the problem. in fact, i misread one of these problems in the midterm, which caused me to have to redo an entire question and cost me dearly in the end. oh well, it's mostly my fault anyway. perhaps divide-and-conquer is too simple a principle for the experienced problem setters out there and the kick comes from writing the story and weaving it in.see more 00

nus. l struggled with this course and found it very demanding even though i performed well for cs 2040 s. this course is intensive with a strong emphasis on proofs and rigorous analysis, and also involves mathematical computations that could be challenging if you are rusty in calculus.the grade distribution for the exams are typically right skewed. therefore, don’t be disheartened if you find your performance to be below your usual standard compared to other courses as majority of students are likely to have scores similar to yours.however, despite these challenges, it is very hard to fail this course as the professors are generally quite generous in the continuous assessment (ca) component, which makes up 40% of the course. although it is extremely time-consuming (one has to complete 5 out of 6 written + programming assignments), it is still possible to achieve full marks for this component as there are bonuses for tutorial participation and lecture quizzes.do note that the course differs significantly between sem 1 and sem 2 depending on who is teaching, and the ca components will also vary. for ay 23/24, sem 2 was better as the content is more effectively taught (many people complained about the teaching in sem 1).tipstextbook: the clrs textbook is highly recommended. it explains many problems, albeit in much more depth than required. it's good if you can truly understand it, but some content is much tougher than what is required.external resources: try out other schools' cs 3230 equivalents. you can easily find questions and solutions in pdf format of the topics covered in cs 3230 from other schools online. i would say the key to this course is to be exposed to a wide variety of algorithms and learn how to tackle each.i would suggest exploring mit’s 6.046 j, which is the cs 3230 equivalent over there. please note that the curriculum at mit is both more extensive and in-depth, which greatly increases the difficulty of their assignments.more in-depth review

formally comes from best 5/6 programming and written assignments worth 8% each but there's bonus 3 m from tutorial participation (1 m for 1 qn answered) and 2 m from in-lecture quiz participation as well as miscellaneous bonus marks from challenge questions in assignments.clearing cumulative 40% from the above sources is enough to pass, and this sem had a ~90% pass rate before 40% finals was administered, so essentially you should not expect to fail.the assignments themselves - both written and programming - were good practice for the topics. the programming assigs can be a bit cumbersome but doable if you model concepts taught in the lecture faithfully. i particularly liked the question asking us to implement a master theorem solver. the questions on dnc/dp/greedy can be painful to debug (even the tas felt so) but satisfying to solve.midterm (20%)1.5 hr paper worth 40 marks comprising 15 m mcq and 25 m open-ended on divide and conquer, probability & dynamic programmingmedian was 19.5/40 so a generally tricky paper to get right, which aligned with my experience. but there was a disincentive against ""trying your luck"" for the open-ended questions (essentially 0.5 m if you leave a qn blank but 0 if you write nonsense), so the median would naturally be depressed since most would rather not risk writing nonsense.final (40%)2 hr paper worth 80 marks comprising 40 m mcq and 40 m open-ended on randomized algorithms, greedy, amortized analysis, np-completeness.final stats:overall median: 38/80 mcq median: 22.18/40,open-ended q 1 median: 3.01/10 q 2 median: 5.17/10 q 3 median: 4.19/10 q 4 median: 3.45/10 i felt the final was more doable than midterm both due to better personal time management and the question difficulty but the median ended up at still less than 50%, which to me reinforces the expected rigor of this course. essentially you can smoke stuff for the questions but your best bet is 40-50% of the marks if your logic isn't precise or your proofs are incomplete/handwave-y. nonetheless writing something that is generally correct but incomplete/imprecise can evidently still get you to the median at least.overall thoughtsone of the best-taught modules so far for me not only because the profs transmitted the otherwise scary content in an intuitive manner but because they put a lot of effort into increasing our exposure (6 assignments with solutions, 3 post-assignment reflections, 5 optional problem sets with solutions, in-lecture quizzes with explanation, etc). i felt this was really important for a course like cs 3230 where exposure is key and we need much help applying moderately heavy technical/mathematical concepts. the profs were also judicious with how much they expected us to know beforehand and even still they took the initiative to prepare supplementary material on asymptotic analysis and probability theory (which of course can be brought into the open-ended exams) as well as recap definitions where necessary (such as what a bipartite graph is).aside from the teaching, the content itself was very interesting to me in terms of strengthening the rigor of concepts skimmed in cs 1101 s and cs 2040 s. i felt the course struck at the heart of cs in many ways (i particularly enjoyed asymptotic analysis, greedy, reduction, and np-complete). i frankly did not expect anything from this course due to its reputation and my performance in cs 2040 s but in the end it was a very smooth experience that inspired me to check out cs 3231 and cs 4234.expected grade: b (~65%; overall median is ~68% which prof said is

covers what 2040 did on graphs, divide and conquer, dp, greedy, runtime analysis. content is mostly slight improvements from 2040 so generally fine. i found the midterms okay, slightly challenging but

basically saying you should do it to save your grades. (adjusted to 4 + 2 according to the other comment) the cap is still 100%, the bonus only kicks in if you have not hit 100% yet.content difficulty: 8/10 as expected of an algorithm mod, it is not going

correct (except those 3). they mark based on your effort. i even spent a long time on a single question, gave up and wrote ""i'm not sure how to do this, but here is what i got..."" and gave a wrong answer, and still get the marks for it. also, never submit your assignment late. i was late by 1 minute once and my marks are cut by half.other than that, the workload just comes from being able to catch up with the weekly lectures, which are honestly not an issue. i find the lectures to be concise in teaching you the fundamentals, then the assignments and tutorials are enough to further your understanding. with these, the exams should be manageable.experience: 9/10 the tas heading this module are really knowledgeable. every part of this module is also very smooth sailing. the only controversy is probably the one regarding the bonus marks. honestly, i don't really care about it so it doesn't affect me much, even though i am only getting 4/10 for the bonus.really this is about the mindset you went in with, i took this module to learn and decided to forgo the priority of my grades for a better learning experience. hence, these bonus marks are just incentives to me, and i believe those who actually done it truly deserves it, for helping others in the discussions or attempting the assignments (which are not easy at all).see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+aanon

is no first half at all which is fair since midterm and finals are of the same weightage.honestly, most of the topics end up being more manageable than expected, except for np topics which can be quite confusing. lots of proving, so if you've done well in cs 1231 (and maybe cs 2040 s) perhaps you'll be fine.i found the administrative things to be a bit messy this sem though, as i would expect big cohort module to be more well managed in the admin side. sometimes the profs forgot to upload the tutorials slides (not just once), or uploaded the wrong files. worst of all, although the profs mentioned that the bonus section are optional, they never clarified the cap for the bonus marks, i.e whether the optional pas will be capped if one's assignment has reached 20%, or whether it is upon 100% for the entire module. many has tried to clarify but to no avail and this ends up to be a module with a total of 110% since the bonus section became compulsory (the curve has shifted since everyone do it iykwim).overall, i think i learnt quite a fair bit in this module, and some of the things can be helpful for interviews such as the topic for dp and greedy algorithms. if you don't

was online unless you had chosen a physical tutorial slot.lectures:the lectures were generally ok in my opinion. prof warut covers topics with enough examples. the slides are also readable without the lecture but it is easier to understand with the lecture. there are notes for each slide which may help to further understand the topic, however, i did not read them.assignments:the assignments are homework on the topic covered in the week. the deadlines for the assignments were 10 days from the lecture date. the assignments were doable though weaker students might need some help to answer some questions. the assignments are once a week so there were 12 assignments planned (1 week was removed due to midterm), week 13’s assignment (assignment 12) was cancelled to help ease the end-of-semester workload; thus 11 assignments in total.tutorials:the tutorials are easier homework in that they require less time although there might be weeks where the questions are harder than usual. your mileage may vary depending on who is your ta so i shall not comment much on this.programming assignments:there are 2 programming assignments where each has a partial mark and a full mark. each assignment is 2% so each mark is 1%.the 1 st programming assignment was about rolling hash which was doable as the problem was solvable with the knowledge from the lectures. this programming assignment was released in recess week.the 2 nd programming assignment was probably harder in my opinion. the problem was a dp problem and required further optimization on top of the dp solution to get full marks. this programming assignment was released in week 12 which added to the end-of-semester crunch, so if you normally crunch at the end, you might be tempted to skip it (it is optional afterall).midterm:midterm is 30%, 60 marks. it was held online via zoom and was open-book.stats:- median: 25- average: 26.2086- 25 th percentile: 19- 75 th percentile: 31.75 midterm questions were

a lot more theoretical, and familiarity with the content in cs 1231/s would definitely help. topics covered include dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, linear sorting, sssp & apsp, randomized & approximation algorithms, and np-hardness.lectures were recorded for this semester, and there were pre-recorded videos by the prof as well, which basically covered the same content. tutorials were conducted by undergraduate and graduate students, and mostly delivered in a similar manner as most cs modules. however, some of the graduate tutors would go through some additional content beyond the lectures as well.this module has biweekly written assignments consisting of two questions each, as well as two programming assignments (which can be done in any language). the assignments were tough, so be prepared to spend a lot of time on this module if you did not do so well in cs 1231/s and cs 2040/c/s. luckily, prof was very accommodating throughout the semester, and he often replied swiftly to queries and gave hints on the forum to help students in the assignments.midterms and finals were both open-book. for this semester, the cohort average for midterms was rather disastrous, so the finals was made to be significantly easier.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+bernard 6 years agotaken in ay 18/19 sem 1 under prof chang ee chien.this module is a largely mathematical and theoretical module that covers topics such as big-o notation, sorting/searching, graphs, np-completeness, and associated algorithms in those areas.  proofs of the various algorithms discussed are covered, and students are expected to devise algorithms and write some proofs in the exam.content is relatively light compared to many of the cs 210 x modules, so little memory work is required.  while there are a number of algorithms covered in this module, the exams place significant focus on the ability to devise new algorithms and prove various properties about them.  it is more important to learn the proving techniques and algorithm design techniques rather than memorising the algorithms covered.there are some homework assignments in which students are required to devise and implement a solution to a well-defined problem (similar to the style of many competitive programming questions).  students can complete these assignments in either c++ or java.  these assignments are graded solely on correctness; no marks are awarded/deducted for coding style.  prior knowledge in at least one of those two programming languages is assumed - there is absolutely no c++ or java refresher provided.there are weekly tutorials, where the tutor goes through some tutorial questions.  i suggest that students try out the tutorial questions before the tutorial, so as to get some practice on devising and proving algorithms (which is really important for the exam), and to make it easier to follow the tutor's line of thought.prof chang did not teach this module very rigorously (in the sense that there was less focus onprovingthe correctness and efficiency of algorithms) - he skipped over some algebraic manipulation and placed more focus on intuition instead.  (for a more rigorous cs 3230, i recommend taking the module under a different module coordinator.)  however, his exams were well-designed - all the questions were clear, precise, and mathematically sound - so during the exam, it is generally easy to tell if the answers you have written are likely to be correct.midterms and finals are open-book.  there are no group projects for this module.see

other reviewers mean when they label this module ""cs 2020++"". but to me, the module was probably more of ""cs 2020++++"".the syllabus:the first half of the semester overlapped significantly with whatever data structure and algorithms class that you'd have taken before this. in the first half, we covered asymptotic (big-o, theta etc.), divide and conquer algorithms (think merge sort), probabilistic analysis and algorithms (think quick sort), counting sort, radix sort, decision trees, and amortized analysis. the difference between these and previous classes was that i found them to be a lot more rigorous in terms of the analysis and mathematical thinking (proving).the second half of the semester covered more foreign (to me) grounds: dynamic programming (dp), greedy algorithms, np-completeness and approximation algorithms.1. lectures and recitationsthis module had a flipped-classroom structure, which meant that it was essentially up to your own discipline to clear the webcasts each week. unfortunately i started lagging behind the webcasts early on, and consequently recitations (which had an atrocious attendance rate, by the way) were much less useful than they could have been since recitations were just sessions to practise questions related to concepts in the webcasts. it didn't really help that the webcasts were super old (2005 videos from mit open-course); the grainy footage on my retina display just made me lose focus even more. if you're confident you can probably just miss the webcasts and self-study the lecture notes/clrs.2. tutorialsanother painful session of trying to answer questions related to concepts from the lecture notes. utterly unmemorable. its hazy memories can be merged with the recitation sessions.3. continuous assessment (40%)(a) homeworksthere were four homework assignments throughout the semester. the first assignment gave me a shock because it was only after i got it back that i truly comprehended the depth and rigour which this module demanded. it was the first of many ""oh sh*t"" moments that followed later on. luckily i knew zai folks who were kind enough to carry me through these dark times.(b) programming assignmentsthese assignments were much less fun than those which i did previously in other programming methodology and data structure/algorithms modules. meh. just don't be too last minute and you should be fine.(c) participationthis meant participating in the archipelago questions (recitations and tutorials), and doing the odd tasks (e.g. 50 shades of recurrences) when they come along. apparently accuracy is not taken into account here, merely the act of participating.(d) challenge questions (optional)bonus questions for the zai folks.4. midterms (20%) and finals (40%)look at my year's midterms and finals for a more accurate representation of future midterms. exams became open book from my batch onwards, and i think the difficulty level increased correspondingly.to secure a decent grade, make sure to max out your ca (possible since 40 is the max and it's possible to hit 48). the rest...just try to catch up with the lecture content (or if you're already good, just make sure you can answer all the recitation/tutorial questions). other questions depend on luck, intuition and insight.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+hou

grading for this module. i believe the grade of this module can be estimated quite accurately based on the grade of the following 3 module: [cs 1231, st 2132/st 2334, cs 2010/cs 2020]. do expect getting similar grade as the above mentioned modules.for the content, the algorithm covered in the first half of the course should already be seen in the previous algorithm modules, and if you have paid some extra effort in understanding the performance of the algorithms like mergesort / quicksort and dijkstra algorithm you should find it very easy. the second part of the module teaches about np-completeness, dynamic programming, greedy algorithm and approximation algorithms, you need some talent in logic and analysis to understand it very well. those topics are very fundamental for future study in algorithms or theory, but not as useful in software engineering.from the experience of being a student and a ta later, i realized that this module has a very strange property: it is very easy for many (many here means much more people than those who always top every module they take) and also hard for some. i speculate that the module requires a minimal level of matured mathematical proving technique and a minimal level of algorithmical creativity. once you have both, you would find it easy, otherwise it is very hard to do (since hard work does not help)..ruomusee more 00

(i will say with a completely straight face that i learnt more about proofs and mathematics in ma 1522 than in cs 1231 s...)(i also happen to agree with the person masquerading as ""jonathon teo"" in this thread...

knowledge of proofs or discrete math e.g h 3 math or something like that. it is even more difficult for poly students since we basically stop doing math after o levels unlike our jc friends (well some courses still do but it’s not like h 2 math). it means most students will struggle with this course and the teaching methods used does not help students learn effectively (unclear lecture slides, tutorial questions overload etc.). the time required for this module is very very high. my advice is to not take it with other high workload / time required modules. i took it with cs 2030 s and ma 1521 which is not a good idea. pro tip to do well for exams: do well for graphs and trees. maybe counting and probability too if you can! personally, i did the assignments alone because of the academic cheating warning but it’s an open secret that people collaborate for it so you probably should.lecture:the lectures are 3 hours each week, 2 hours + 1 hour. prof aaron is usually the one speaking for most chapters while prof chin and dr ashish takes the rest. the lecture in pptx form is quite difficult to digest since everything is went through really quickly. some example answers are not given in the slides so you have to watch the recording or attend lectures in order to know what the answers are. some chapters are neither coherent nor concise which makes students confused. a lot of explanations are verbal only so you will not find it on the slides. the lecture slides are not sufficient for tutorials.tutorials:the tutorials are 2 hours each week with a ton of questions. it will take you at least a few hours to finish it (if you actually attempt) and the lectures are not very helpful for the questions. tutorials questions are used to teach extra knowledge that the lecture does not cover. hence, the difficulty of tutorial questions can be very high. the relevance of the lecture slides (i mean the examples given, not the overall abstract idea) is almost zero for some tutorial chapters. depending on your tutor, the answers for the tutorials will be given in their own choice of presentation. of course, prof aaron will release the answers at the end of the week but your tutors may have shortcuts that will be easier to do and understand than the given answer key. initially, my tutor did not give any sort of tangible answer sheet to take away after the tutorial lesson so max effort was needed to understand his explanations in the session (it was overwhelming to say the least). however, towards the end he created his answer key with his explanation for us so it was quite helpful for us. always give feedback to your tutor! you should definitely attempt the tutorials questions. i personally gave up attempting all of it half way through the semester because of how many questions there were and the amount of time required to complete it.this module is not (i think) the most su-ed course in computing without good reasons. i have to admit that 1 semester is impossible to teach us good discrete math and writing proofs but the information overload makes it difficult for students to learn the basic concepts well. i liken it to fishing. you need to be able to catch the small fishes first before moving onto bigger catches right? similarly, getting us to write proofs or answer more complex questions when we do not understand the basic concepts is extremely difficult.aiken[not] dueet! but maybe you can ……see more 20 replyshare ›show more replies −+ssocacademicvictim 6 months agoeditedtaken in ay 24/25 s 1 profs: aaron and 2 others

students have to be very familiar with, even though the exams are all open-book. being able to thoroughly and completely understand the concepts and the logic behind each theorem and definition is the only way to score in this course. the explanation by the profs don't really help in making the concepts any less abstract, so it is good to regularly consult your tas. the exam questions for this semester was on a whole other level of trickery and abstractness. i would personally advise students to just focus on learning as much as possible and enjoy the thinking process when doing questions, rather than focus on the bellcurve and being exam oriented. there aren't many practice questions given, so do make good use of what you are given to properly digest the content. like any other math mod, proper understanding is the only way to solve the convoluted questions in exam. aaron takes pride in setting the most sadistically difficult/tricky questions. don't feel bad especially when doing

time. but prof aaron does his best to make lectures entertaining with special segments and funny jokes, so i can respect him for that. prof aaron did most of the lectures, while prof ashish took over for the counting and probability section, and prof chin took over for the functions portion.if you have a background in h 3 math, you should be very comfortable here due to the considerable overlap in topics like proving and mi, and dealing with more abstract math concepts. there is quite a lot of terminology being thrown around, and i wouldn’t recommend falling behind as concepts get frequently reused in later chapters. i found the tutorials to be pretty straightforward to complete, and can see why other reviewers might find this module rather lackluster and not much of a challenge. but i did enjoy learning more about topics in discrete math and getting to exercise my proving brain.at times the unrigorouness (is that a word) of the module showed, and some of the proofs did seem a little freestyle. not that i am a rigorous math student myself anyway so i don’t really have the right to talk.unfortunately many of my friends without a very strong math background struggled with this module, with the extremely large amount of terminology thrown around, and a certain level of intuition being assumed. i don’t agree with immediately going in with the su mindset, but i can understand why some people give up on the mod halfway and aim to pass. if you had to choose between this and cs 1101 s i agree with focusing less on cs 1231 s.workload / weeklectures: 3 htutorial: 2 h

write out wrong solutions it ends up kind of counterproductive and a bit of a time waster. i did not have a problem understanding the suggested solutions, but my ta did come in a little unprepared at times. he usually finished tutorials in 1.5 h, but i heard some other classes could never finish on time. my tutorial slot clashed with cs 1231 r so i unfortunately couldn’t take it; it would be nice to have the timeslot released earlier for timetable planning purposes.assignments: 20% (2 of them)we were usually given about 1.5 weeks to complete them, and they covered the past few weeks of

not putting name, tutorial group, and shading (applies to exams as well). i don’t really like the assignments as the nature of it being take home leads to a plagiarism fest, and the bell curve is

an okay lecturer, and though he may be lacking in several aspects, my ta made up for it with his outstanding tutorials.i apologise to my ta eldon, bcoz most of the tutorials i turn up without doing the questions (there are too many to finish fr), and i only caught up after reading week. other than tuts, workload for this mod is actl q light, all you have to do is do 2 assignments and show up for tuts and tests to su it. for the amount of proofs we learnt in tut, its surprising that in the end, there was little to no proving in midterms and finals (im not complaining ofc, altho some may think its bcoz aaron is in retirement mood alr). also, finals was crazy bcoz lets be real, a normal human being wouldn't be able to attempt all the questions in time. assessments are open book, unlimited

(50%)this module is known as the 'proof mod' however you can definitely get by well without being a math genius and conceptualizing proofs as soon as you see the problem. reason being that usually the hardest proof questions in the exams are only solved by a handful of students, so you can actually safely skip these questions.content difficulty: 6.5/10 personally, i didn't find the content itself in this module to be too challenging. relations and cardinality were two chapters that took me a while to fully grasp, but  i felt that the rest of the content was quite intuitive. of course, content difficulty differed greatly from the actual difficulty of the mod.workload: 8/103 hour weekly lectures and 2 hours of tutorial. doing the tutorial sheets often took me more than 6 hours as they had challenging proving questions.the heaviest part of the workload in my opinion was the assignments. no collaboration is allowed, and the median marks are quite high. for both assignments i ended up burning an entire weekend in order to finish them on time and to satisfaction.prof: 10/10 prof aaron is passionate, has a great sense of humour and very friendly. he keeps his lectures interesting, and i would recommend attending them live if you are free as the lectures are quite engaging.assessmentif you are aiming for an a- and above i'd recommend you try to get full marks for your assignments. make sure your proofs in your assignments are solid with no gaps in reasoning so as to leave no reason for marks to be deducted.midterms and finals have both mcqs and structured questions. only a fraction of the structured questions will be proof questions. keep in mind 3 things for the midterms and finals.thinking fast is a pre requisite to this mod and the assessments are speed runs. do not expect to finish them, especially the finals, on time up to your satisfaction.the average mark for the mcqs is usually around 60%, so doing well in them can easily be the distinguishing factor that nets you a high grade. make sure your concepts are clear.especially for the finals, ensure you finish all the easy questions (such as counting and probability questions) before attempting more difficult proofs, as you may not have time to look at every question.breakdown:tutorial attendance: 5/5 assignment: 20/20 midterm: 16.5/25 (didn't finish and misread a

completely destroyed despite studying so hard for it. from then on, i skipped all live lectures and attended tutorials without attempting the questions. assignments were pretty okay and we were about 10 days to complete (a lot of time, slowly do). some of the answers given are ridiculous, like they can pull a theorem out of somewhere unrelated. to me the proving questions are impossible to do. the

tougher. personally, i find this course unnecessarily tedious, with a lot of emphasis placed on writing the perfect proof, where every statement is justified by an axiom or a result from lecture / tutorial, as opposed to the intuition behind proofs, which i feel would have been more meaningful.many of the seniors online seem to praise prof. aaron for his teaching and for being a decent human being. i can’t say much about his teaching as i skipped every lecture, but quite a few of my friends who attended his lectures didn't think aaron did that great of a job. granted, even the best prof’s teaching won’t work for everyone, but that is something to keep in mind, i suppose.content-wise the big difference between this and ma 1100 besides it being easier is that it covers graphs and trees in place of number theory, which is probably a good thing since those topics are covered in cs 2040 s, and number theory being not as useful. well, unless you plan on doing cryptography next time.but

(5%)midterms (25%)finals (50%)(context: no h 3 math, 0 proof experience)honestly walked out of this mod feeling like i learnt a lot yet nothing at the same time. aaron spends the first half of the sem yapping about how important proof writing and rigorous mathematics is, which only makes me laugh in pain when i see the tutorial/exam answer keys being filled with extremely ""english"" and rather un-rigorous mathematics (in my rocky journey through this mod i consulted math major friends for help on various occasions only for them to tell me how awful the so-called 'proofs' provided are). it's really not a good look for the mod. the mod is also infamously an su mod, but i now realize it's not the difficulty itself, rather the iq checks and contrived proof writing that makes people not want to put in the effort.final exam slapped me in the face with not a single proof question and just walls of iq tests and computation-heavy questions. i am neither happy nor sad, because while i will have definitely been more cooked had proofs come out, it really makes me wonder what exactly i had been learning here. even with this being the mod that serves as an introduction to proofing, the assessments really only reward students for spotting the usual tricks, pitfalls and 'patterns' in exam questions. i feel i had only enjoyed the first half of this mod, when i was being exposed to new concepts that can be widely applied in proofs rather than just walls of text and definitions (looking at you, graphs and trees).shoutout to my ta eldon who basically carried me through this mod. while aaron is not necessarily the worst lecturer, i basically learnt 90% of the content from eldon alone. he clearly puts in a lot of effort answering questions in the groupchat and creating supplementary material far superior to the answer keys provided. he goes far more in depth with the concepts than aaron ever does, which made sure i had the fundamental mathematical understanding needed to comprehend everything going on in 1231 s. if i manage to not su this mod it will be thanks to him. although i do apologize for turning up without doing the long ass tutorial sheets in the later half of the sem.workload: 4/10 (can get by without doing any homework except for the assignments, but the less mathematically inclined like me will have to put in more effort for the grade)enjoyability:

50%overviewbefore starting this module, i have been told by many seniors that this is the infamous s/u mod. in fact, in his first lecture, prof aaron did mention some of these rumours too. however, since it was my first semester in nus, i decided to try putting in effort to see if it was as bad as what my seniors have said.the course is generally a comprehensive one on discrete mathematics. it starts off with logic, proving, set theory and relations. after the midterms, we move on to slightly more cancerous stuff like functions and cardinality. the final topics, probability and graphs, are far more manageable, however we did not go into much detail.workloadlow. there is lesser content compared to the other soc modules. however, due to the nature of this course, effort is definitely required to have a strong understanding of the concepts involved. furthermore, assignments and examinations can be insanely difficult, testing content never taught before in lectures/tutorials, so it can be beneficial to practise more in your free time. personally, i sped through lectures at 1.5 x speed and attended tutorials, re-reading lecture notes a week before the examinations alongside spamming past year papers.lectures are 3 hours in total, twice a week, with the second lecture being only 1 hour instead of 2. this year, the profs went hybrid mode, so you can attend physically or on zoom. attendance was not taken. lecture were conducted mostly by prof aaron, while prof chin took one or two topics. i enjoyed prof aaron's lectures as he will attempt to spice things up through live qnas or some interactive components such as playing the monty hall game on stage. in my opinion, the lecture slides are very comprehensive and you can read them without watching the lectures. however, not watching his lectures is generally a bad idea, and you will know why after viewing the first question of the past year papers.tutorials are 2 hours per week. attendance is taken, and the best 10 of 11 sessions are counted in your 5% component. tutorials have both simple and challenging questions, so do not be discouraged if you cannot do some of the lengthy proofs or difficult computation questions! my ta, dr ashish, is extremely knowledgeable and competent. at the start of every lesson, he will give a summary and recap of the key concepts taught in the previous lecture. thereafter, he goes through the tutorial questions. for easier questions, he will call on random students to share their answers, or to write their proofs on the whiteboard. for harder questions, he will simply write out his solution and explain his thought process behind the steps.for every chapter, there will be ungraded canvas quizzes for you to attempt at your own pace. even though they are optional, i highly recommend you to attempt the questions as they are rather challenging and provide a good indication of your level of understanding of the chapter.there are 2 homework assignments given out throughout the semester, and we are given a week to work on them. some of the questions are definitely harder and/or more tedious than the examination questions, so i would advise you to devote a few hours to completing it. the median for each assignment is pretty high too (which makes sense given that this is a take-home assignment). if you are aiming for a high grade, do take this component seriously and try to score full marks, since 20% is quite a lot of marks.i am aware that there is a textbook for the course, however i did not touch it at all. in my opinion, the slides are good enough.examinationsexaminations were fully open book. only printed materials were allowed. calculators were allowed too, though they were only useful for the finals paper (mostly for questions on counting and probability/graphs).midterms was a 1 hour 30 min paper with 15 mcqs (2 marks each) and 4 structured questions. many of the questions do not require working. my cohort did better compared to previous batches and the average was 60.4%. i found the paper to be relatively easy, and was able to complete it well within the stipulated time.finals was a 2 hour paper with 22 mcqs (2 marks each) and 5 structured questions. mcqs tested content taught throughout the semester, however the entire section b was on topics taught after midterms. the paper was much harder than the midterms, and i could not do about 10 marks worth of questions. once again, the test was open book, and many questions (including the entire probability section) did not require working at all.one thing i found respectable was that the teaching team is highly responsive to feedback. a few of our mcqs in finals were re-marked after appeals were made by students.tipsin my opinion, this course is somewhat of an iq test. during examinations, new definitions and concepts may be introduced, and students will have to complete a few questions based on the new information provided. moreover, some of the proofs are really difficult and it takes some degree of brain power to think of the solution under time pressure. hence, i advise incoming students to do more past year papers and ensure you have full content mastery before moving onto the next topic.furthermore, the tutorial solutions can be rather lengthy at times, and it may be tempting to skip them. if you need help, there is an online qna forum called ""sets"" for you to post your question anonymously. one of the lecturers will reply within a day or two. the professors are extremely helpful and approachable. some students (including me) booked additional consultation slots with prof aaron during the recess/reading week. however, i must warn you that they fill up fast, so do book early to avoid disappointment. prof aaron himself said that his slots were full some time during the reading week.lastly, in this course, you must substantiate all proofs with theorems taught in lecture. the good news is that you are also allowed to reference results/theorems derived in tutorials or assignments. this means that it would be extremely helpful to prepare a cheat sheet with the different theorem names and lecture + slide number / tutorial question number for easy reference during the examinations.final wordshonestly, the curve for this course isn't too bad. it may be discouraging at first, when you are still not very used to mathematical notation, or some time during midterms when you learn relations and functions, followed by cardinality. i strongly urge you to push through. it gets easier over time once you are more familiar with the concepts.till this day, i still don't understand cardinality fully. prof aaron shares similar sentiments, saying that it is one of his weaker topics in the course i believe the weightage for cardinality is low in the final paper, so if you want to ditch a topic, it would be this.overall, for prospective students, this course is rather well-designed, though being an introductory module in discrete mathematics, you do not get to approach certain topics (e.g. graphs) in greater depth. that being said, the highlight of the course is definitely the cute names like aiken, dueet and noasu. you also learn that a knight always tells the truth but a knave always lies. if you are a cs major, you will have to take this course anyway, so i don't think my words have much impact on your decision.for those who want to study beforehand, here's thecs 1231 s website(available to public).overall gradestutorial attendance: 10/10 (median: 10/10)assignment 1: 39/40

nganaiken sueetcontent difficultyfor content and slides refer to the cs 1231 s website.some topics might seem counterintuitive at first, such as quantified statements, but i eventually got used to them. notably, prof aaron does reference the textbook a lot in his slides, but he does take out a lot of content from the textbook (for instance, skipping binary and logic gates). some other topics might come naturally if you have done h 2/hl math in jc, since topics like relations and functions are covered then just in less depth. counting and probability and mathematical induction are similar to jc math, so once again that was not much of a challenge. however, there are other topics that took me a long time to wrap my mind around. many of the proofs in functions were not easy, as were concepts like equivalence classes and the abundance and overloading (reuse) of notation sometimes made it confusing. cardinality was an awfully confusing topic that to the day of finals i didn’t really understand, and i believe much of the cohort was in a similar boat - some in the module telegram group suggested just skipping the cardinalty open-ended questions in the exam. overall, the content ranged from understandable to very difficult.workloadnot particularly high if you do the minimum, but if you want to be ahead, expect to spend a lot of time. 3 h of lectures (also broadcasted on zoom and recorded) per week, 2 h of tutorial. attendance is graded in tutorials so to get the 5% you cannot skip more than 1. i spent about 1-4 h (depending on how much time i had) a week trying the tutorial questions before the tutorial, but still couldn’t do many of them. likewise, if you want to read the textbook to be ahead of the content that prof aaron covers (he moves very quickly), expect to spend an additional 2-4 h per week.teachingprof aaron tries to be humorous and engaging, and props to him for putting in the effort. with some topics, he is very good at explaining and breaking down concepts to help the uninitiated understand them. however, with others like cardinality, even after rewatching his lecture i was unable to understand much. the textbook was slightly better but not by a whole lot. he is clearly passionate about the content and teaching it. prof chin seems to target a ‘higher level’ of student, perhaps one who already has some groundwork done, some basics understood and has read ahead a little. he is not as engaging and i was at times better served by reading the slides or textbook in my own time, but to each their own. my ta was also great and happy to answer questions, and provided many helpful tips.assessment 5% was from tutorials - just attend them to get 0.5% each time, best 10 of 11 are taken.10% each from assignments 1 and 2 - slightly harder than tutorial questions, but the level mean is extremely high so it was imperative that i got as much as i could correct. presentation, supporting proofs and sufficient explanation were also required.25% from midterms - a bloodbath yet somehow the level did decently well with an average of 60%. i did far worse than the mean, and felt that the mcq questions were more of a test of intelligence and adaptability than understanding of the concept. many of the questions were testing if you could find extreme cases and whether they would fit into the definition of the concept or symbol or terminology being used, rather than an understanding of the concept that might be sufficient for application, which was both pointless and painful. scoring far below average killed my motivation for the rest of the module.50% from finals - just as terrible as midterms, though not particularly weirder or significantly more difficult than previous years’ finals. once again, just like midterms, it felt like a test of intelligence because there were instances where terms were redefined or new terms were introduced, just to test if you can understand the new definition and apply it instead of testing your understanding of the concept that was taught in class. the usual testing of definitions by looking for extremes showed up. while the usual long open-ended graphs/trees and counting/probability questions showed up, the difficulty was increased, as was that of mathematical induction. many of my peers felt that given all these quirks, there was little to no point studying and practicing for finals, and i can’t really debate that given that preparation for finals didn’t get me all that many questions correct. for the matter, it might be more worthwhile to retry tutorial questions instead of past year papers…concluding wordsprof aaron does try to make the module interesting and enjoyable, and if not for the assessments i might actually enjoy the challenge. but both midterms and finals were hugely discouraging, and the assessment structure seems to remain - very difficult for not much of a tangible reason (at least not at this level). it’s rather unrewarding and hugely discouraging since you can have the best conceptual understanding and still fail to do well for a variety of reasons. unfortunately, this course is a prerequisite for other cs courses.expected

tan tuck choy and leong hon waii would like to give a different take on this module.even though this module is notorious for being difficult, at the end of the day, it really boils down to your math inclination (doing well in high school math does not really count if it is due to sheer practice, instead of understanding of the concepts) and logic and reasoning. it may even be the easiest cs module you’ve taken, since this is basically a math mod (albeit a unique one as it feels puzzle-like). unlike the other math mods cs majors have to take, in which you can get away with just by grinding and practising questions, this mod requires thinking and understanding the concepts, which may have contributed to its notoriety.this mod has a rather low workload among the cs mods in terms of assignments. the main workload probably comes from understanding the content and doing the tutorials (you can get away with not doing some of the tutorial questions, though not advised if you need more practice), which heavily depends on your math ability.there are only 2 assignments throughout the semester, and each of them can be done in a single day or over the weekend (though you should start early if you are struggling with the content). a few questions may be challenging, and most proving questions are tedious (could just be me who makes proofs overly thorough). one tip for assignments is to be as thorough as possible in your proofs, i.e. every line of proof should have justification.lectures: prof aaron is friendly and is always enthusiastic to meet us every lecture. the lecture slides are well-designed and quite unique; it often has real life scenarios and pictures which made it more visually appealing to look at and made the concepts easier to visualise. prof aaron often asks questions and lecture polls to engage with the students and find out which areas the students are weak in. the 1-hour lectures are sometimes used to go through questions that students may struggle on. thus, the lectures probably made this mod more bearable for most people.one concern i have is that the teaching style is different from most ma proving mods (not necessarily a bad thing, but something worth noting for those taking higher level ma mods; in fact, i do prefer this mod's teaching style as it is less dry). while the lectures here focus more on testing our understanding of the concepts taught and some common traps that students may fall into (not that it does not go through proofs of results), ma proving mods focus more on the proofs of relevant results and more theorems to use. this also means that this mod is more “from first principles” rather than applying theorems to get the result. as a result, i experienced a bit of a culture shock when i took ma 2108.tutorial questions were difficult, more so than the assessments. there were a lot more proving questions, with some being too difficult to actually be tested in assessments (as remarked by my tutor). they were just there to reinforce understanding, so do not be disheartened if you struggle to do some of them.my tutor, dr ashish, is experienced in teaching this module. before going through the tutorial, he would briefly explain the applications of the concepts in cs and recall the definitions of important terms. afterwards, he may pick students to answer some basic questions and some of the easier tutorial questions. for the harder questions, he would write the proof on the board and explain his reasoning. he teaches it this way as it allows us to see how the proof is created from scratch and process it better (which did work for me). his experience really shows as he can explain things and write down proofs without much hesitation.midterms and finals actually do not have many proving questions, around <= 20% of marks are on proving. this was a lot less proofs than i have been led to believe, in fact, most of the proving that you do probably comes from tutorials and assignments. instead, the assessments tests more on quick thinking and how comfortable you are with applying the concepts/definitions under time constraints, kind of like solving puzzles (although solving the proving questions would still put you at a significant advantage). tutorial questions may be helpful here. unconventional tip, but before spending time double checking other questions, try not to be afraid of proving questions and attempt some of them, as your marks are more or less secured if you can do them.one advice for this module in general is to follow the definitions closely and fix any wrong intuition that you may have before, as some things can be quite counterintuitive for most people.see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ccentes 2 years agoeditedtaken in ay 22/23

taught by prof aaron, before prof rajendra took over. both profs were knowledgeable and helpful. i personally struggled the most with topics like relation, functions and cardinality. i think this module really requires you to supplement your knowledge through other means like youtube videos etc.i would say not to be disheartened if you struggle with this module, you might understand the topics better when you learn how they are applied irl.tutorials:i attended prof rajendra's tutorials. tutorial questions were tough, with some past year questions mixed in. i would say try your best to do, but i usually left quite a bit of blanks. prof rajendra will usually assign questions for each pair of students to present but don't worry, if you don't know how to do the questions. you can ask him for help or he might take over it for you. i also really love that he isn't afraid to say that he can't do a particular question if he doesn't have time to prepare. it really humanizes him and made me feel like it's okay that i am struggling.assignments:were really challenging and time-consuming. but try your best to score as well as you can. i did not attempt the last question for the 2 nd assignment since i had no idea what it was asking and it hurt my score a lot.midterms/finals:i scored above median for both. midterms was really manageable. just make sure to spam your pyps and score as well as you can for the mcqs.finals was quite a fiesta. i'm not sure why prof aaron decided to set such a difficult finals for a batch with pre-dominantly poly students (i think). the median for

covers discrete maths. discrete maths is a topic that almost every computer science degree worth its salt will teach you. simply put, it covers mathematical structures and the interactions between them, such as logic, sets, graphs, and trees. the topics in the first 2-3 weeks will have you wondering ""hmm, maybe the seniors exaggerated this module's difficulty?"". be warned, for the topics ramp up very quickly, both in terms of content as well as difficulty. on many days, you'll think you understand a topic until you see the tutorial questions and realise that you were deceived. it's like that pretty much every week from week 5 onwards.this topic is definitely as challenging as everyone says it is. while enjoyable as a topic itself, the prospect of studying for the midterm and finals made me feel sick to my stomach. the questions are challenging and push you to the limit in terms of being creative and finding a solution. simply put, it is not for the faint-hearted.however, i would urge you to not go into this module with an s/u mindset. you can learn many mind-blowing and interesting concepts when you study this module, and you should, at the very least, try hard for your first assignment and your midterm. tutorial attendance is a free 5%, please bag that as well. it is very useful.on a more practical note, if you get destroyed by the midterm (by destroyed, i would say well below median) then i'd suggest that you hedge your bets and focus on modules that you have a better chance of scoring at. even if you're at the median, don't be worried as the final exam has a 50% weightage and is a great way for you to make a comeback.the assignments are definitely challenging. attempt them yourselves, and then discuss with your friends to poke holes in your solutions. discrete maths is a very precise subject, and flimsy proofs will not fly.the professors are friendly, and prof aaron always has jokes and anecdotes on hand to lighten the mood and ease some of the stress. he is also compassionate and understands the pressure that students undergo. he loves to remind the class that ""aiken duuet!"".all in all, i suppose i did enjoy the module, although the final exam was quite lengthy and i didn't do as well as i expected. it's definitely an interesting module, so try to keep up with the lectures and tutorials. don't leave it to the end, it is not a subject that can be understood through last-minute studying. and believe in yourself. you might be doing better than you think.my grades:tutorial attendance (5 / 5%)assignment 1 (10 / 10%)assignment 2 (10 /

were based on topics that were covered in midterms. assignments are meant to be completed individually, but almost everyone gets close to full marks for assignments, so that rule is obviously ignored if you consider that the median for assessments hovers around 50%.i was around the lower quartile for my assignments and just below the median for midterms. i was fully intent on s/u-ing, but sage advice from a senior told me to not completely give up because the second half of the module is fairly distinct from the first half, and contains topics that probably favours those with programming experience. i ended up far exceeding my expectations for finals (upper decile).content:this module is known for being tough because most students will have 0 familiarity with any of the content prior to nus. this however means that there’s a relatively even playing field, since most of the students who have prior background and would have ez no kick destroyed the bell curve are probably in ma 1100 or ma 1100 t. that said, complete knowledge of pre-university level mathematics is assumed, and as a former bad student i personally struggled with doing basic algebraic manipulation which you had to show steps for during the early topics. by the end, you could get away with just writing (by basic algebra) in your proofs.of all the modules i took in sem 1, this had the most δknowledge by far for me, and thus was my most satisfying (albeit difficult) module. even though this was my only s/u-able module, the content, especially the later topics on cardinality/graphs/induction, was interesting enough for me to not have the discipline to stop reading the slides/tutorials and focus on saving my other modules even though i was fully intent on s/u-ing this module. most of the content is really helpful for other cs mods, which i wouldn’t have predicted going into the module.something a bit weird that i would recommend is to find someone who takes ma 1100 t (the discrete math module for prospective special programme in math students) and ask for their cardinality slides/notes (i discovered this by accident because i was lucky enough to have a friend who was smart enough to be in ma 1100 t and helpful enough to teach me stuff the day before my finals). cardinality will be the most difficult topic for most students because it feels so abstract and somewhat defies common sense. their module goes far deeper in-depth than cs 1231 s, and a lot of “hard questions” in cs 1231 s that we would through are just trivial results and corollaries for those students. for example, the hardest mcq question in this semester’s finals paper (q 17, 27.6% correct) asks you to verify statements that are trivial results in ma 1100 t lecture slides but incredibly difficult if you only have cs 1231 s resources and a normal human brain.teaching:lectures were taught by prof aaron with some taught by prof leong hon wai, and they were recorded. i did not attend or watch lectures. the slides are good and comprehensive enough to use to study, and my friends say that the lectures are good.tutorials are taught by 1 ta, who can be an undergraduate (usually assigned to 1 class) or a graduate student (usually take multiple classes). you are expected to have attempted the tutorial questions and thus have some familiarity with the content before the tutorials. my tutor was a grad student sherman yuen who was fantastic – i wasn’t the best student and often didn’t pay attention or attempt the worksheets before the tutorials, but when the stars aligned and i did both, his explanations were always very clear, his delivery was engaging, and he makes a huge effort to follow-up on doubts in class via email. if i had to choose between paying attention to the lectures xor paying attention to (+ doing the worksheets for) the tutorials, i would choose the latter.if you have a grad student ta, it is worth being friends with students who have undergraduate tas, because they usually make telegram groups where they dispense past year papers and their answer schemes to their students. otherwise, pyps are uploaded without model answers.see more 00 replyshare ›show more

expected grade: b/b+actual grade: b+; i was more or less near the median throughout the semester. though mathematics in jc was a different animal as compared to the proof-based content covered here, i was never that good at algorithmic maths.)this mathematics module (quite a number thought that this had programming in it at first) was the most normal one i took this semester - free from nonsense but nothing too interesting. most of the course was merely lectures, tutorials, assignments and exams, very much like how mathematics was taught in my earlier days of schooling.the content covered, however, was completely new. i had only learnt some of the counting and probability content in jc, and the other topics was taught in a proof-based manner, as mathematics should be. thankfully, i touched upon the content a little before university started so as to avoid being completely lost, but it takes a while to get used to these things.the mathematics taught here is supposedly rather important in future, for example the tree algorithms, though i doubt the utility of things like equivalence relations and partial orders a little.prof tan taught the content quite engagingly, making it quite easy to understand, whereas i had a little more difficulty getting used to dr wong's delivery. perhaps it was because of his accent, or taking too many questions from students during the lecture, but i ended up going straight to the notes he gave out. my tutor ashish, a graduate student, was supposedly one of the lecturers as mentioned in the soc schedule, but the lectures were given by the two of them. nevertheless, he explained the concepts quite well, linking the mathematics to various areas of computer science.the exams and tests were not particularly easy, and the median mark for the cohort was 29/50 for the mid-terms. of course i scored below the median, but to some extent, such things are luck-based. finals was almost the same thing as the previous papers, where the questions are tricky and you actually need to consider edge cases also. i happily brought a graphing calculator in, but didn't bother to learn how to multiply matrices, losing 3 marks. thankfully my score was slightly higher than the median since i somehow got a slightly difficult proof correct. nevertheless, unless you really know what you are doing, getting a- might not be so easy.this is a compulsory module for computer science students, so there's nothing much to say except to learn whatever you can. obviously, quite a lot of us might be ready to exercise the s/u option on this, and i might fall into the category. otherwise, a course in discrete mathematics might be rather important for anyone who might want to break into the fast-paced and lucrative world of computer science. ma 1100 includes number theory instead of graphs and trees, so pick your poison.[see my other module reviews athttps://spergiemcsperglord....]see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+sspecter 3 years

definitions/theorems mentioned in the lecture notes and the tutorials. our ta provided a link to one for us but yours may not do the same.for the tutorials, we were given a worksheet with questions every week and we would spend the tutorials going over the previous lecture as well as the worksheets. attendance is graded, but even if it weren't i'd recommend attending anyway since if you have a

assigned to his group.the syllabus does not feel like a 1 k mod at all. on top of all the basic integration and differentiation learned from a levels, we are exposed to double integration with polar coordinates, functions of multiple variables, proving of convergence of series among others.the poorly designed lecture notes meant that we had quite a bit of irrelevant content and had to frequently add additional notes provided by the professor, that are annotated with his chicken scratch handwriting. even the last 3 subtopics in the notes were declared non examinable at the last minute during his last lecture.the teaching quality of both profs (i gave up watching live lectures by prof wong after 3 weeks) are not great. prof wong tends to mumble a lot and go really fast, while prof leung likes to go through tons of examples before going explaining the theory. best part is, the examples that he goes through are not even found in the lecture notes. you have to manually append pages to your pdf and copy down whatever he writes. and no, he does not provide these typed out versions of these examples without his handwriting on them.tutorials are non graded and attendance is non compulsory. it's much like jc for my class, where the tutor goes through the answer after getting students to write their solutions on the white board.online quizzes were generally quite easy as you have the luxury of collaborating and using any online calculator. people usually score near full marks for these.midterms was a 25% 60 marks 1 hour paper which was more of a test of how fast you can complete it rather than how much you understand. median was 42/60.finals was a 60%100 mark 2 hours paper that was set way above the difficulty level of the previous semesters (excluding the legendary 20/21 sem 2 paper). many could not completely solve the questions. i will update this review once the stats of this shitshow comes out. some of the past year paper solutions were not even covered in the lecture, and we had to scramble in the telegram group chat to figure out what's going on.overall, this mod made me dislike math even more due to the poorly designed module and unsatisfactory learning experience. if you have a choice between ma 1521 and other math mods, steer far from ma 1521 especially with these profs.my grades:quizzes: 16/30 (i was too honest with not using online

this mod, and spent easily more time on this mod compared to mods like cs 2040 s or cs 2030 s. that was how difficult it felt for me.the learning curve is immensely steep cause you need some a level background to be able to keep up (which we don't have). a lot of times it felt like numbers appearing out of thin air. mostly because a lot of algebraic manipulation and intuition is needed, and you can't easily get this without a lot of practice or time.i spent a lot of time rewinding, rewatching videos, and watching youtube tutorials to just understand what's going on. i also practiced a lot of the textbook exercise questions (btw download the textbook it's really helpful).even with all that i felt it wasn't enough, all is needed is a heavy algebraic manipulation question and i'm gone.lecturer is amazing though. he genuinely cares and tries his best. he gives extremely fast email responses and tries to help as much as possible.i tried whatever i could for this mod and put in a

than an hour a week on this mod. tutorials are not worth attending at all unless you really need to clarify some concepts or calculus problems.homework was kind of humor to be honest. at first, we were told to submit the homework (which were given out weekly) by random-allocated groups in our tutorial slot. however, “due to a directive of the department of mathematics” just before week 3, we needed to submit our solutions individually. it turned out for us to almost always score full marks, as they were given for effort (70% completion is enough) only.there were 4 quizzes (out in week 3-6-9-12 respectively) in fact, but “quiz 0” was there for us to get familiar with the system only. for each quiz, we were given 1 week to complete and 2 attempts in total, in which the higher mark will be taken. if you want to discuss with your friends to cross-check the answers, please be careful as the data for each question might change in the two attempts, but don’t be scared as the format is exactly the same (which means you just need to apply the correct formulas to both data sets).exams set by prof. to wing keung are always more difficult than in other semesters, and my semester was also the case. although there are fewer “questions” (9 compared to 10 in the previous papers), there were a lot more parts in total which made the paper almost impossible to be done within 120 minutes. i just completed 7.5 questions, and for the remaining, i just wrote some dummy things to hope for partial credits.expected grade: a-actual grade: a+ (a bit fortunate, the bell curve is not as

lecture, as the professor taught, we quickly realised that we cannot really hear him at all, and people started walking out of his lectures midway. from then on, the number of students attending his live lectures can be counted with a single hand. if the professor actually remembers to turn on his mic, it would have been much more interesting as his lecture content actually is extended upon what is taught by the l 1 slot's prof wong, with applications in computer science. however, a bad first impression sets the tone for the rest of the semester. also, prof dong has a habit of teaching about half a lecture faster than prof wong.i started attending prof wong yan loi's l 1 live lectures for the rest of the semester, so that i can attend prof eldon's lectures for cs 2040 s. the situation is slightly better here, the number of students attending his live lectures can be counted with two hands. he teaches like a typical professor, do not expect any of that ma 1522 prof jonathon magic.tutorialmy tutorial sessions are conducted by mr. cheng jingpu. as tutorial attendance is not mandatory, by the end of the tutorials there were only 2 students left in the classroom, me being one of them. i have to say i am impressed that he does all the workings by hand, live in front of us, since that greatly increased the odds of making mistakes. unfortunately that means he often almost overshoot in the time taken.assessmentquizzes: 35%finals: 65%there are 5 quizzes in total, 7% each, released on mondays and due on the same week's fridays, due in weeks 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. you have 2 attempts in each quiz, and they take the higher score. integer solutions are expected. since no workings are required, the earlier quizzes can be solve trivially with the use of desmos. the quizzes towards the end, involving vector calculus, partial derivatives, double integrals, and differential equations, would have to be done manually.the finals was a 2 hour, 100 marks paper with 10 questions, each being 10 marks. topics tested are chapters 1 to 10, so chapter 11 about second order ordinary differential equations and numerical methods are not tested. for our cohort, the questions are distributed more evenly across the chapters. the paper was tough but not the toughest, and i estimate that i could only do about 70% of the paper, and probably made some mistakes. graphing calculators like the ti-84 plus ce are allowed.conclusioni am taking this as a computer science major, and i would say that ma 1521 is like the less glamorous brother of ma 1522. the way the content is taught felt a little arbitrary. as a former h 2 mathematics student, chapters 2 to 5 would be basically a revision, and you should focus on chapters 1, and 6 to 10. h 2 further mathematics students may have a slight advantage as they have learnt things like polar coordinates, volume of revolution using the shell method, and first-order differential equations using an integrating factor. and for h 2 f math students from jc starting in 2025, even more so, as they now cover function of several variables. meanwhile, i expect polytechnic students to struggle very much with this course.many would not be able to appreciate how they can learn the taught content in their every day lives, since prof wong does not really touch on that. there was an attempt by prof dong to pull in the applications in computing, but it is a little hard to understand as a year 1 computing student. but i am sure it will be useful somehow, later on.resultsquizzes: 34/35 (median: 35)finals: ??/100 see more 00

about this course. jonathon should teach ma 1521 on top of ma 1522.i got through this course by studying the lecture notes on my own. to be honest, the lecture notes are the best part of this course

a broad range of topics about calculus, building on topics taught in h 2 math. we start with limits and continuity, the move on to single variable and eventually multivariate calculus. the first 7 chapters (aside from chapter 1 and 6) are pretty much jc math but taught more in depth and overall are quite straightforward. chapters 8-9 cover multivariate calculus like partial differentiation and double integration which is slightly more challenging due to the geometric intuition needed for visualizing 3 d surfaces. lastly, we learn about differential equations, which is the easiest of the new topics, though the computations are quite tedious.chapters 0. real numbers and functions 1. limits and continuity (new)2. derivatives 3. applications of differentiation 4. integrals 5. applications of integration 6. sequences and series (new)7. vectors and geometry of space 8. functions of several variables (new)9. double integrals (new)10. ordinary differential equations (new)11. more on ode (not tested)lectureseach week has two 2-hour lectures. most of the cohort skipped lectures, either referring to the online recordings or the lecture notes. i initially attended the afternoon lecture by dr dong xiaoyu. within the first lecture, dr dong showed a lot of weird quirks, like leaving to go to the toilet midway while going through a question and using a marker with no ink.  even when some students shouted at him to re-explain or get a new marker, he remained indifferent. you can see why i didn't attend any of dr dong's following lectures. subsequently i did hear from some peers that dr dong teaches at a more rigorous level (such as discussing the precise meaning of limits and actual application of calculus in neural networks) so it may appeal to students who are more mathematically inclined and able to understand his thick accent.i switched to prof wong yan loi's morning lectures from 8-10 am from the second lecture onwards. prof wong also has hong-kong? kinda accent but i was able to understand him better than dr dong. prof wong teaches quite clearly and gave many examples to explain the concepts. prof wong does mumble slightly and his teaching pace was a tad slow during the sections which recapped jc math content. while the lectures aren't particularly interesting, prof wong overall teaches well and in particular is effective in explaining the geometric intuition needed for the more difficult topics. he is also quite patient and friendly should you approach him after lectures for further questions. lastly, kudos to prof wong for coming back early from his medical leave mid-semester to lecture the 10-15 of us who showed up lol.tutorialsi attended the first few tutorials and some of the later ones on the more difficult topics. tutorials aren't really worth the time if you can do the questions already. for the more difficult topics like chapters 6,8,9, it may be useful to attend if you can't do the questions. the tas are phd students unlike ma 1522 and they can generally explain the questions well, though mine had a thick accent. on a tangent, syu jhan-cyuan wasn't my tutor but when i walked into his first tutorial, he seemed really energetic and prepared a lot of extra materials.assessmentsquizzes: 35% (5 quizzes, 7% each)there are 5 fortnightly quizzes starting from week 5. each quiz has 7 questions and we are given 5 days to complete. unlimited time is given and 2 attempts are allowed (best score is taken). each question expects an integer answer. the quizzes were fairly do-able but beware of tricky/tedious computations. check your calculations and compare answers with other students and deepseek (higher accuracy than chatgpt). there are different versions of each question so do be careful when comparing answers with others. there were also annoyingly marking errors and major typos (incorrect numbers)in some of the quiz questions.finals: 65%most likely 10 questions, with most questions having 2 parts. we are allowed to use any non-programmable calculators including the jc graphing calculator. grinding past year papers is useful as the format is the same across the years and some questions are repeated (like the fly, amount of chemicals etc). this semester's finals was fairly challenging, with a similar level of difficulty as the previous 2 semesters. i unfortunately made a lot of careless mistakes and the answers for my last 2 questions had really weird values. if taking in semester 2, everything is riding on finals so expect a tough bellcurve and try your darndest to avoid making careless mistakes.overall thoughtspersonally, i did enjoy the course more than most of my peers as you can probably tell haha and the content like multivariate calculus was pretty interesting. i do feel this course can use a ma 1522 style revamp so that tools like matlab can be used and that the course can be more mathematically rigorous. ma 1521 at present just plugging in formulas and doing the following computations which can be quite tedious at times and honestly really repetitive after a while. i think i have a headache after solving bernoulli and first order differential equations god knows how many times in the past few weeks lol. prof wong is a solid lecturer but i feel lectures could be more interactive like dr jonathon teo's math cafe in ma 1522. this is by no means a bad course, but it is easy to see

exist,  riemannian sums were not taught properly, but where sequences and series still did. reviewer has further calculus background from self-study.tl;dr not very difficult, just practice your numerical computation and you should do well. worst case, ask anyone from jc you know, or dig up your old h 2 math notes. depending on how adventurous you're feeling, can even be a 0 workload module.things you learn:most of this stuff is quite basic computation (esp. if you have a goodnon-programmablecalculator), so don't be intimidated.if you are a jc kid / know jc kids, this is standard jc fare:- standard derivatives, monotonicity (increasing/decreasing), concavity, tangents, normals, related rates of change, implicit differentiation, parametric differentiation- standard integrals & techniques (fundamental theorems of calculus, partial fraction decomposition, integration by parts), volume of solid of revolution (disk method)- sequences and series (taylor & maclaurin series, geometric series)- vectors in euclidean space (3 d)- separable differential equations, logistic curves.and new stuff everyone will be learning together (hooray!)- limits, continuity and derivatives from first principles (note: no epsilon-delta)- derivatives: l'hôpital's rule, rolle's theorem, mean value theorem- integrals: riemann integrals, integration by substitution, improper integrals, volume of solid of revolution (cylindrical shell method), arc length- sequences & series: (absolute) convergence, convergence tests (integral, comparison, d'alembert's ratio, root, alternating series), power series- vector calculus: parameterized vector functions, implicit functions, gradient vector, directional derivatives- multivariable calculus (differentiation): 3 d curves, surfaces, conics, tangent planes,- multivariable calculus (integration): double/integrated integrals, volume, surface area integrals, polar coordinate systems- ordinary differential equations: 1 st order linear odes, 1 st order inhomogeneous odes, bernoulli equation- (extra: 2 nd order linear ode with constant coefficients, method of undetermined coefficients, euler's method)subjective review:workload: 1/10

better to watch lecture recordings at your own pace. if you have any questions to directly ask the prof, he also seems quite open to answering them. i stopped going to or watching lectures from week 4

the week before. i stopped attending tutorials from week 4 onwards.syllabusthe first seven chapters are basically h 2 math but in more depth. the last four chapters dive into functions of several variables, double integrals, and odes, which is the tougher part. the final exam consists of around 45% single variable calculus and 55% multivariable calculus.weekly homeworkusually just the stuff covered in the lecture notes, but the questions are changed slightly. you should be able to finish it within 1-2 hours but some of the topics are slightly harder like sequences and series. the homework assigned for a particular week is only due the following week, so you have plenty of time to complete it. the grade is given based on the completeness, not the correctness of your work.the homework assignments also include self-practice questions that don’t need to be submitted with your solution. initially, i skipped these self-practice questions, but about a week before the exam, i realized i didn’t fully understand the content. so, i started working through all of them, and i think it made a difference.quizzesthe quizzes are extremely hard. they have 8 questions each. the numbers in the questions are also randomised so be very careful if you intend to discuss with friends. i recommend taking your time to do the questions, and then using tools like wolfram alpha and desmos to check your answers. i personally took an average of 5 hours to do each quiz.final examthe paper was just the quizzes on steroids. it was harder than the past year papers as well (except for 19/20 s 2). i only completed 75-80% of the paper and didn't have time to check.overalli actually found the content fun. unfortunately, i didn't have enough time to explore the content in depth. the

each)final assessment: 65%overviewthis module is an extension of h 2 calculus, so some of the content (about 50%) should be pretty standard to most soc students. we start off with single-variable calculus, limits, sequences and series, before touching on a bit of vector calculus, followed by multivariable functions and double integrals, before concluding with a basic coverage of odes.workloadlow. there is not much content, especially if you come from jc. perhaps some concepts like limits, series and multivariable calculus may require extra attention to develop strong mathematical intuition for, so it would be wise to approach these topics with patience.lectures were 2 hours each, twice a week. attendance was not taken, and all lectures are recorded online. as such, i did not attend any physical lectures, often watching them at home at 2 x speed. personally, i preferred prof liu's lectures as she was clear in demonstrating the applications of theorems covered in class. being an introductory computing course, she briefly covered proofs, but reminded us that it was okay to not understand them as proving was not a requirement in this course.tutorials were 1 hour per week. before every tutorial, we had to submit our completed questions on canvas by the previous sunday. this constituted 11% of our final grade. however, the good news is that we were graded not based on correctness of our answers, but by completion. as long as you complete 70% of the tutorial, you will get full marks for that week. it goes without saying that almost all students will obtain this 11%. during the tutorial, your ta will go through the questions with you. he will also answer any queries you might have. like many others, i found the tutorials quite useless, since the tutorial questions were often extremely easy and straightforward. since attendance was not taken, you may skip it if you are relatively confident of your ability in this course.there were 3 quizzes spread out throughout the semesters. each quiz was 8% of the final score and had 8 questions, so the weightage per question was pretty high. the quiz questions were extremely difficult and i spent half a day on each of them. however, since it is a take-home assignment, you are expected to get full marks in them. in fact, the median for all 3 quizzes was 8/8. for calculus or limit questions, you can even check your answer online. one thing to note is that there are 2 versions of the same question, differing in numerical values, so you may get slightly different questions from your friend. nevertheless, the steps to solving each question remain the same.there are lecture notes for the course, provided at the start of the semester in one large pdf file. personally, i found the lecture slides more than sufficient, so i did not touch the lecture notes at all. however, i am aware that the lecture notes have extra questions for practice if you so desire. furthermore, there are extra practice questions at the back of every tutorial. unlike the extra practice in other mathematics modules, most of these extra questions are well within the syllabus, and may be tested in the examinations, so i would advise you not to skip these useful questions.examinationsthere is only one examination, which is the 65% closed-book finals held at the end of the course. one a 4 double-sided help sheet was allowed. the questions were extremely difficult (not as difficult as the legendary ay 19/20 s 2 paper, but still quite challenging) and 2 hours was definitely not enough. even though there were only 9 questions, many of the questions had subsequent parts, and those parts were sometimes not related (e.g. part (a) and part (b) were to find the value of 2 different limits, and part (c) was to solve a totally unrelated double integral), so the actual number of questions was far higher. most questions asked for an exact answer, or utilised variables in the expressions, making a gc not very useful. i ended up barely using my scientific calculator and not using my gc at all. even though i managed to complete all questions, i realised i had made a few careless mistakes after review with my friends.tipsgiven the assessment structure, it goes without saying that the finals will mostly decide if you get a good grade or not. for those aiming a high grade, do ensure that you get the full 35% before the finals. furthermore, the examination questions are often very challenging and/or do not test concepts directly, so it would be wise to practise more by doing past year papers or the exercises in the textbook. do attempt to simulate examination conditions by doing the papers under timed conditions too.nearing the examinations, the professors will open up mass consultation slots. prof to conducts it in-person while prof liu conducts it on zoom. it is an open consultation, meaning that students can join as and when they wish to ask questions. however, you may also book consultation slots with the professors or your ta individually if you require more attention and help.final wordsall in all, this module was pretty manageable. the lack of midterms, coupled with the easy tutorial question may potentially promote complacency. however, as long as you keep on practising, it isn't too difficult to get a good grade for this module.one thing i did not like was that in many lectures, we would be thrown theorem after theorem, with little to no explanation behind the derivation and motivation of the results. however, this is understandable as this is simply an introductory module in calculus, where mathematical rigour is low.overall gradeshomework: full marksquiz: 8/8, 8/8, 8/8 finals: unreleased as per mathematics

differentiation and integration with applications, series/sequences, vectors, multivariate calculus, double integration, ordinary differential equations. limits was an extension of jc h 2/hl math content, while differentiation and integration and vectors were pretty much the same as that of jc. those were not too difficult, all things considered. however, limits took a while to understand, especially with the squeeze theorem. series introduced a whole lot of tests that i never completely understood, but application and doing questions with them was manageable except for the taylor/maclaurin series. if i could remove one thing from the syllabus, it would definitely be the taylor/maclaurin series. multivariate calculus was rather confusing, introducing in fairly quick succession concepts like implicit differentiation, partial differentiation (which were not too hard to understand) and then their applications on surfaces and planes in r 3 space (that was very difficult to wrap my head around) with all sorts of visualisations that would be interesting but ultimately not tested. there were many seemingly similar though ultimately different questions in that chapter, which worsened confusion. double integrals were something that i felt i could either see (for the regions and limits) or not, and thus could either do easily or not bother trying. odes were not well explained in the notes, but once i eventually understood them, i felt that it was possibly the easiest of topics that i had no background in (so excluding simple integration and differentiation).workloadminimum of 2-3 h a week. if you are able to read notes and understand the week’s content in 1-2 h, and then spend another 1 h on the week’s homework, you could probably keep up with just that. otherwise, lectures are a total of 4 h per week, and tutorials another 1. homework is compulsory (and is 11% of the total grade, though one just needs to attempt 70% of the questions to get full credit for each homework), and worth doing to be sure of your understanding of the concepts. tutorials are for going through the homework.teachingdr liu is, from what i’ve heard, the better lecturer. she explains concepts and tries to break them down, and explains what’s necessary to know and what’s just good to know, such as whether the understanding of proofs and derivations of various theorems was necessary (thankfully not), and various methods of applying the laws and theorems provided to different styles of questions. her teaching seemed mostly aimed at helping students understand questions in a way that they could apply concepts and doing, rather than understanding how the concept came about, which given the limited time and difficulty of the questions, seemed fair. my ta, in the few tutorials i attended, was very clear in breaking down concepts and questions for the tutorial in a way that was rather helpful, but ultimately i could figure out most of the homework by myself, by referring to the notes or asking peers so i felt little need to attend most of the tutorials.assessment 11% from tutorial homework (discussed above)8% x 3 from quizzes. they were about the difficulty of some exam questions, but are open book with 2 attempts and no time limit, testing a few previous chapters. everyone gets these correct, so just be sure to check work and understand the concepts in previous homework questions and doing these should not be too difficult.65% from finals. this was tough and for some reason my favourite bernoulli ode question was removed (relative to previous years’ finals). i felt that strategising was necessary - avoid wasting unnecessary time on the double integrals, if you can’t visualize the areas and limits to integrate within. similarly, some questions on simple integration ended up being rather complex, so i felt that if i couldn’t immediately ‘see’ a way to solve the question, it would not be worth my time. side note for ib students: the ti nspire graphing calculator was not allowed because it’s programmable (i have not verified this) and not on the seab approved list of calculators, while the a-level ti 84 was. i have no idea whether this will change in future semesters since other reviews mention a change in coordinator quite frequently. anyway, many questions required an exact answer so the graphing calculator wasn’t always of that much help.concluding wordsthis is a rather rushed math course that you could self-study if you wished, since all the lecture notes are provided at the start of the course (though not all the homework). some choose to do the bare minimum and then su the course. i’m just happy that i’m done with it. like the other reviewer from this sem has mentioned, revise your jc content before starting, especially for differentiation, integration and vectors. for the matter, if you’re unsure of these topics, your jc math notes are probably far better than these as the notes for this course do seem to assume some knowledge. i'm probably going to su this.expected grade: csee more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+dogshitcsstudentstan 2 years agoma 1521 reviewtaken

1521 changes quite often, so take the reviews with a grain of salt if the module coordinator is different.i feel that unless you are planning to su this mod, this mod is not as easy as what people say in general (or at least what i have been led to believe). sure, the concepts are not that abstract and are easier to understand than cs 1231 s or ma 2001, but the computations can be quite tedious and that there are quite a few topics covered. furthermore, there are some tricks that may make a seemingly very tough problem easier, that may not be obvious. to do well in this mod, you need to have practice and mastery in calculus, which may amount to more workload than some other core mods. i can argue that for a specific group of people (most people do not belong to this category), it can be harder than say, cs 1231 s.lectures: the lectures start off slow and becomes a little too fast after the midterm break. i feel that the pacing could have been balanced better. the lectures themselves were ok but could be improved. prof leung seems to spend too much time on examples imo (may be a good thing if you rely on examples to learn). while he did spend a bit of time explaining the concepts, i felt that he could have explained them more in detail and help us visualise the concepts and solids/regions better, like what ma 2104 does.tutorials: they were pretty good as they helped me catch up with the lecture content, but i agree that it can be too fast if you are not that familiar with calculus in general. the ta did highlight a few important tricks that would be used over and over again. i think that if you can do all the tutorial questions on your own (within a reasonable amount of time), you can do pretty well in the exams.quizzes: either i had not practised much at that point, or the quizzes were really that hard, because i felt that they were harder than midterms (and not that much easier than finals) with the time limit given (10 questions in 1 hour). anyways the curve is heavily skewed to the right and is not a good indicator of the curve in exams, so do not be too worried if you are not doing that well in quizzes, curve wise.midterms was pretty manageable if you have mastered h 2 math calculus (or single variable calculus in general), with maybe one tough question. however, time was very tight. i think most people could not finish the paper in time (8 questions to do in 1 hour!).finals was quite tough. even though some of the questions were quite standard, most of the questions were quite demanding. this was where some new hidden tricks might be needed here. although the time was less tight than in midterms, i also spent some time getting stuck on some questions. the questions were diverse and tested a lot of concepts, so mastery in most of the concepts taught is required to do well. and this includes algebraic manipulation for these new topics.as this mod is focused on computations, practice (whether from tutorials or pyps) is key. quick and skilful algebraic manipulations and recognising the problem quickly is needed for one to do well in this module. visualisation skills (e.g. for 2 d regions) would help too.see more 00 replyshare ›show more

maths, the first half of the module should be relatively familiar to you. to learn the content, i read the textbook (thomas calculus) along with the lecture notes. the textbook is quite comprehensive with the explanations, but also contains extra content that is not in the syllabus, so do remember to cross-reference with the notes given.the lecture notes provided are amazing, and i never found a need to reference the lecture recordings or slides. i found that working on the lecture exercises and past year papers was generally sufficient in preparing for the exam. the answer keys for the tutorials are provided if you still need another avenue for practice.overall:you should consider self-studying this module. from what i've heard, many students plan to s/u or give up on the module, so

critical for me in the later part of the semester.i didn't have the best experience with this module. i was told that to do well in this module, you would have to be nearly perfect as the curve is really hard and many students taking the module with you would have done h 3 mathematics. the first half of the semester is pretty much a-level calculus. the upper quartile for the midterm exam was 50/60, and i got 44/60 which was when my hope for this module sank. however, the final exam is 60% of the grade, so you can try hard even after midterms.although the first half of the semester is a-level calculus, i still found the midterm exam quite hard. maybe the questions asked are harder, or maybe my brain had just slowed down from ns.the second half of the semester picks up pace really fast, and frankly i still have no idea what i even learnt. i stopped attending tutorials after week 8 (it isn't compulsory), and at one point i had a backlog of eight hours worth of lectures. the topics were way too complex, and they require visual understanding, which i'm terrible at. instead, i started prepping for the final exam maybe 5-6 days early, and just worked on many practice papers to learn the techniques to solve questions. essentially, as i mentioned earlier, i didn't learn concepts. rather, i learnt how to solve certain concepts to do better for the final exam.the quizzes are also very challenging. you're given one hour to work on it, and it can be at any time of the day but only within that 24 hours. needless to say, everyone does their best to collaborate with others for this quiz. somehow, even with collaboration the questions are very challenging to solve within the 1 hour time limit.the final paper was tough. it was probably harder than all but one of the practice papers we looked at. i thought i was done for sure, and expected a maximum of 70% on the final exam. however, i probably got lucky as many people might have given up on the subject / found the final exam very hard. also, i'm guessing that people said the bell curve for this module is very hard as many of them attempted this module during the covid semesters, during which time it was obviously a tougher bell curve.all in all, it's a very challenging module for most people i'd think, because i consider myself to be fairly good at mathematics and my friends seemed to agree that the module was quite hard. if you're really struggling with the module, i'd recommend to just focus on other modules and study enough to s/u the module, as in my opinion it isn't that essential for computer science students. prof wong yan loi was very friendly, but i'm afraid the subject matter is such that he couldn't really make it much more interesting. he was friendly and prompt in answering questions. if you're able to solve the tutorial by yourself, i think there is no point in attending the tutorial (although that isn't the reason i skipped tutorials xd).my grades:quiz 1 (4 / 5%)quiz 2 (3.5 /

zoom/physically. workload was 1 tutorial every week but even that is not compulsory. module is graded based on 3 quizzes, 1 midterm and 1 finals.for the first half of the sem, you learn manageable content. mostly just limits and calculus. our midterms was quite doable.for the second half, shit gets hard. you start with sequences and vectors, and then you go into vector eqns of 3 variables and stuff. finally, you end with differential equations (which is honestly the most manageable topic of the second half). i'm quite sure i screwed up my finals lmao.you might also find yourself very confused during this mod. personally i think prof leung is not very good at explaining the concepts to students, and his handwriting is honestly not that good. he also tends to make careless mistakes when writing out working. since he uploads the annotated slides with his annotations, you may find yourself spending a lot of time trying to decipher what he wrote. also, tutorial and pyp answers are also pretty unhelpful, they tend to skip steps and if you're already behind for the mod, you might have a hard time. therefore i recommend joining the 1521 chat and asking questions instead.a lot of

handle calculus techniques arising in their courses of specialization. in addition to the standard calculus material, the course also covers simple mathematical modeling techniques and numerical methods in connection with ordinary differential equations. major topics: preliminaries on sets and number systems. calculus of functions of one variable and applications. sequences, series and power series. functions of several variables. extrema. first and second order differential equations. basic numerical methods for ordinary differential equations. (note: sets, number systems and differential equations were basically not tested this time)difficulty: 5/10 enjoyment: 7/10 expected grade: a-actual grade: b+ - didn't quite expect that due to the bell curve the professor showed after test 3, but i didn't do too well for test 2 anyway, and quite a number should have scored close to full marks for the weekly quizzes. perhaps such is the nature of modules where much of the content has been covered.this was the most problematic of all the modules i've taken so far, at least from the instructor's perspective. to be fair, i don't even get the rationale behind the course. the calculus i've done earlier on in school, though by no means rigorous, should be enough for computing and i should be able to learn multivariable calculus next. but this module only scratches the surface of multivariable calculus, even though it appears to be important for cool stuff like machine learning, so i'm not sure what the department is thinking.ma 1521 is basically a rehash of the calculus that you would have learnt in high school (at least for singapore) with a little more rigour. on top of the things in the a levels (if you're from jc), you would also learn about limits, l'hôpital's rule, arc length, series and a bunch of things they couldn't be bothered to teach you the other time round. multivariable calculus (partial derivates, optimisation, lagrange multipliers, double integrals) was saved for the last two lectures, so if you want to learn more calculus, you could always take ma 2104, as some whom i know might go on to.the module was the first iteration done under this professor and arrangement. it was unfortunately ridden with problems right from the get-go, which was really unfortunate since the professor was surprisingly kind and passionate. the first red flag was the fact that he was the only instructor dealing with an entire cohort of more than 700 students - there were no tas whatsoever. i really admire his tenacity of marking upwards of 1000 test scripts (thank goodness another instructor was there to help him mark half of the scripts)!to make things worse, there was no absolutely exam proctoring at the start. no attendance marking, no camera set up to show the desk and the computer screen, no screen recording, no nothing. for the cl 3208 module i took last semester, the quiz was held in exactly the same manner, but that quiz was set so that nobody could google the answer. obviously it's a completely different ballgame here - you could easily google so many of the questions and pay for the wolframalpha auto-solver, and nobody would have bat an eye. the test was also set to be too easy, with most of the questions way below h 2 math standard. the median was apparently 45/50 and there was a huge block sitting close to full marks on the bell curve.then quiz 2 came and went, under the same arrangement. whilst grading, prof chan realised that something was quite wrong. perhaps a bunch of idiots (probably from hall) decided to band together and share their answers, so there were a number of really similar scripts in there. unfortunately, this time the test wasn't that easy so these idiots had a large advantage over the others. there were just far too many of the suspicious scripts so they ended up not investigating further, which was quite disappointing. i didn't do too well for this either.quiz 3 was fine since they had proctoring, but i think there was still one invigilator to more than 100 students, so it would be hard for the poor invigilator to spot if anything was wrong. thankfully, the test wasn't very difficult, but it was towards the end of the semester and everything piled up. perhaps not that many people bothered to study the multivariable calculus and series, all new topics, so they didn't seem to do as well.at least the lectures were a saving grace. prof chan taught quite well and really showed his passion for the subject. during the breaks, he would chat with us about his life as a professor, displaying old pictures of himself and his graduate students.the zoom chat during the lectures was also a sight to behold. right during the first lecture, some idiot said that he got 90 rank points for his a levels, got accepted to harvard but was not sure if he could cope with the pace of this module. to make things worse, the idiot impersonated someone else. otherwise, it was filled with students with far too big an inferiority complex, making weird (and sometimes inappropriate) jokes. even then, only 200 people showed up for the lectures towards the end of the semester, so they really missed out on the reckless comments on zoom (though at least one person didn't quite like the vibes of the zoom chat, but i fit right into that kind of self-deprecating loop).overall, the module was more fun and enjoyable than i thought even though the administration was riddled with many issues. for the coming semester, ma 1521 would be taught by another professor, so i cannot speak for that. i was told some people might want to take it as an elective module, but i would only recommend it if the person is good enough at high school calculus, perhaps somewhere around getting a or b throughout internal jc math tests, or already learnt the syllabus beforehand (trust me; i know far too many people who fall into this latter category). otherwise, try to learn something more eye-opening. if you're a computing student, just enjoy whatever you can. don't be too stressed out by the bell curve and s/u it if you really need to. i still don't get the point of this module.[see my other module reviews athttps://spergiemcsperglord....]see more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+aanonymous_student_1233 years

also covers one-variable and two-variable limits, partial differentiation, double integration, series convergence, and integration using polar coordinates (i might have missed out some additional topics but this is most of it). if you have a solid foundation in h 2 math calculus, this course should be relatively manageable, but be sure to do additional practice to see different types of questions.prof chan is a very nice and dedicated lecturer. instead of just providing theorems and methods for us to use, he also explains how they are derived. this could be a turn-off for some students, but if you are looking for a more rigorous understanding, you will enjoy it. he makes time to answer students' questions during lectures. on top of lecture slides, he also provides notes

the prof explains the topics ok enough and goes through examples.the difficulty of this course is insane and much harder than anything in high school maths. it's helpful if you took calculus in high school but even then be prepared to get demolished by the assessments. i'd highly recommend getting  thomas' calculus by addison wesley, the textbook the course is based on, and just grinding out all the problems in there. grinding out past year papers is good too. luckily, prof was kind enough to provide these in luminus. also, don't be afraid to use graphing calculators or online tools like desmos.the tutorials were also webcasted and the facilitator just goes through the questions on the tutorial worksheets that are uploaded in luminus. to be honest, the tutorials weren't helpful at all since a lot of the time the facilitator doesn't go through the hardest questions. instead, it was better to just check out the solution sheets that were also uploaded in luminus and then email prof

and so he changed ca 2 to a take-home quiz. the median score was 10/10, while mean was 9.78/10.ca 3 was more manageable; the format was 10 mcqs followed by 5 fill-in-the-blanks. personally, the 10 mcqs were pretty straightforward but the last 5 questions were alien to me. but general consensus among the cohort was that the whole paper was tough (?). i felt like it was pretty okay, maybe around 10/15.also, no backward navigation was allowed for ca 1 and ca 3. so yeah the difficulty was insane.final thoughtsi took this mod as a ue because i thought it was just h 2 math with some extra

personally, i don't find the tas very helpful, since most questions in the tutorials are doable and solutions will be available on ivle. however, my ta did provide a summary for every chapter, so that

very standard, with about one question for every chapter, and sometimes the questions sound very similar. for midterms, it was on ivle and consisted of only 4 mcqs. for the finals however, there were

the final. personally, i think that if you wanna score well for the final, you should try to attempt as many past years as possible (up to ay 2015/16 sem 2 cuz i think there is a change in syllabus from that year onwards) cuz the questions are kind of similar and i think by doing them can help you in the final. you can try to do past year before ay 2015/16 sem 2 if you have run out of questions to do but read the paper first and make sure you choose those questions that only involve the concepts that are taught to you in your sem, but personally i wouldn't recommend doing it cuz sometimes you may not even know that the questions involve other concepts that you are not taught with.also, try to be careful when doing the questions to avoid making careless mistakes; however, a personal take is don't check your answers until you have finished all the questions in the final cuz it will take up your time to do other questions and in the end you may not be able to do other questions that may be relatively easier. this year the prof gave partial marks to the questions, meaning that even you don't know how to solve the question, just write down some working or any equations in your

essentially build around the same stuffs that you learn in secondary/jc levels, except that you will be doing them at a more advanced level. if you realise that you haven’t touch math in a very long time, you might want to brush off the dusts of your old math textbooks to refresh your rusty brains.just like old school math, most of the questions simply require you to identify and use the appropriate formula/methods to solve. or, to put it in the words of dr ng, ‘just do blindly’ xd some of the more challenging questions will be covered by your tutor during tutorials.assessment:midterm – 30%final – 60%assignments – 10% (2 assignments, 5% each)as you can see, there’s no participation marks in this mod. but do attend the lectures or at least watch the webcasts so that you learn the proper steps of tackling every type of question. also dr ng is a good lecturer and his funny random jokes/remarks help me to stay awake during his lectures :d. tutorials however will depend on whether your tutor is good or not. solutions are usually provided in the tutorial sheet itself or uploaded at the end of the week.assignments are basically a free 10% since you can check/copy/compare answers with friends before submitting. midterm was easy but final was a trainwreck xd. turns out dr ng likes to set really hard ‘killer questions’ in the finals to differentiate the really good students from the rest. but he’s also very generous with cheatsheets (final we are allowed to bring 4 double-sided a 4 cheatsheets) so at least you don’t have to memorise any formula which is nice.unless you are a math genius or want to spend all your time doing past year killer questions, you can kiss goodbye to your a/a+. my advice is to master the ‘basic’ questions (i.e. those that only needs you to die die follow the method/formula). if you do enough practices and are careful during exams then you’ll easily have an a-/b+ at hand. there are a handful of topics that are easy to master and score full marks

convergence. you will also learn some approximation techniques in the last chapter as well. unlike the other math modules i took this semester, this module has very little emphasis on proofs and instead, is quite calculation heavy (the bell curve is quite steep as well).dr ng is also an interesting and pretty good lecturer, often making humorous remarks/comments and being able to explain algorithms and problem solving techniques in very intuitive ways. what i liked was that he sometimes went a little further to elaborate on some calculus algorithms not in our syllabus, in case we were interested to program such stuff. his pace is also a little fast though, so you probably need to concentrate in lecture in order to understand what he's writing, because he tends to jump from place to place when he writes. lectures are webcasted.tutorial wasn't really that useful in my opinion, because the worked solutions were much easier to read, but i thought my tutor did a pretty good job of summarising main concepts from every chapter and explaining how some theorems worked. there are 2 homework assignments as well, which constitute 10% to your final grades.difficulty of the questions in

your friends for homework. however, i recommend doing it yourself before checking your answers with friends. you are given an ample amount of time for each homework, so use this opportunity to test your understanding.homework 1 tests your basics, linear systems and matrix algebra. this should be doable for most people. however, i would say the homework was quite tedious as we were required to find the rref by hand for a matrix that had unknowns in it.homework 2 was the hardest in my opinion. there was a question about the intersection of subspaces that i still don’t fully understand even now.homework 3 was the coolest. there was a question that had us derive the formula to find the n-th fibonacci number and honestly, i didn't even know this formula existed before taking ma 1522.the

(even harder than the pyp). but there were less theoretical questions and more computational questions than the pyp.finalsfinals are 15 mcqs (45 marks) with 4 structured questions (35 marks) and we were given 2 hours. i found finals to be more manageable than midterms, especially the mcqs. however, some of the structured questions were more challenging than what you would see in the homework. i also noticed a strong emphasis on lu, qr, and svd factorizations in the structured section, so it’s worth diving deep into these topics to prepare.examplify tipsthere are a ton of mrqs for both midterms and finals. just know that examplify only allows you to choose up to the maximum amount of answers. so if the question was meant to have 3 answers, you can only choose a maximum of 3 answers before the other options gray out.also if your matlab crashed during the exam and you are not able to reopen it, restart your computer and raise your hand. when your computer restarts, reopen all your programs and then finally, reopen examplify. examplify will ask you to resume, and if you took too long to resume, it will require a resume code which you need to get from the invigilator. my matlab

prof: jonathan teo (the goat🔥)rather tough, definitely harder than ma 2001 for ay 24/25.to score well, you need both intuition and speed when it comes to solving questions. unfortunately, i'm a slow typer and my brain went a little haywire after looking at all the floating numbers on examplify. not expecting a good grade (a- and below)what is good about the course:active community, great place to clarify doubts and misconceptions.way the course is taught fosters interests in students (unlike a certain other math course😴)prof and a certain utop go out of their way to answer questions.what can be improved:transparent marking system for homework, pyps. throughout the duration of the course, we did not know how the marks were allocated, and the importance of showing each step. i lost quite a bit on homework due to skipping steps.certain quizzes had a large pool of questions while others had a smaller pool making it easy to memorize. i feel it would be better to take the highest score, but let each quiz be /10+ instead?attending tutorials felt rather pointless. could try a more active approach like flipped classroom (like cs 1101 s) or math cafe-esque.certain important identities were covered under the extra section in tutorials, namely null(a) = null(a'a), which i feel should be moved to the main section or the lecture.could benefit from greater coverage regarding:matrix algebrabrute force approach for solving matrix equationssignificance of pre/post-multiplying elementary/triangular matricesproperties of matrix decompositions/factorizations (as defined in this course)universal method to solve for unknowns in matrices (instead of a rather nonstandard approach that varies with qn)least square solutions (and polynomial interpolation)derivation of transition matricesorthogonal complement of subspace, relation between implicit and explicit formintersection of subspaces(the above topics were not common sense, unfortunately...)how to be prepared:be very very very proficient with matlab or your own program by midterms. who knows when the next 6 x 7 matrix would appear... also apply the equivalent statements (invertible square matrix, full rank = rows/cols) into everything you do, makes answering some questions more straightforward.finals should have a question that tests on svd, and another that tests on a decomp (23/24 qr, 24/25 lu) or possibly some other matrix equation. basically you're given something like a = bc..., some information regarding the entries and properties of the matrices, and you have to assemble everything like a jigsaw puzzle. the focus on this kind of question was not immediately apparent for me, and ended up spending way more time than i should have...see more 10 replyshare ›show more replies −+mmath merchant 6 months agoedited 24/25 sem 1 prof jonathon teotldr: decently hard mod, but jonathon teo is the goat. imo its even worth it to wait till next ay to get him again.idt coming from jc gives any real advantage at all. quizzes are free, homeworks are free as long as you collab with friends. finals was easier than midterms, so don't be discouraged at midterms.for this ay, prof conducts math cafes which are not compulsory, but they are really good. unfortunately i already scheduled a lesson in that timeslot before prof announced the math cafe slot and am unable to attend. would have been better if prof had released info earlier. for tutorials i have to confess that i have only been to the first one, and on my first tut, the ta(an undergrad) was murmuring and reading off the slides like though the ta couldn't be bothered about being a ta, after which i didn't feel like going anymore. attendance isnt taken, so most ppl try to find prof jonathon's slots and attend them instead.i confess that i have only been to 1/11 tutorials and i only binge watched math cafes, did tutorials the week before exams, but i have been consistently keeping up w my understanding so i think the workload was ok. plus prof is really the goat when it comes to challenging us conceptually in math cafes. prof likes to test concept more than computation so he allows matlab(matrix algebra calculator) in this course.h/w note that he only teaches sem 1, sem 2 is very different, may not have matlab. another downside is that this mod is relatively new and only has 1 pyp when i took it (now 2 for the next batch), so v little practice u can get thats relevant. theres ma 1101 and ma 2001 papers but they arent completely relevant as i feel they are testing more on computation by hand.prof also started out a telegram channel where people can ask questions and answer. profs and tas are very active and promptly in answering questions, going above and beyond. h/w not every student is appreciative and some are snark in their comments on confessit, emboldened by anonymity to give curt and elitist remarks. ofc, this cld just be a vocal minority since all it takes is just one person, one confession post and one argument thread to ruin the good intent that prof had when he set the channel up.i am no cs god though (i got absolutely cooked in 1101 s), i just like math and do better in math. it is definitely possible to make a comeback in finals. assessments are open book, even include digital notes as long as offline.assessments: (q 1/median/q 3)quiz: 100/100 (100/100/100)hw 1: 40/40 (37/39/40)hw 2:

(proud to say i think i cooked, sautéed and deep-fried the finals!)additionally, had a real blast in the telegram chat discussing linear algebra results and challenges, although some other people don't seem to share the same opinion... (got asked by a nameless faceless one to stfu, most curiously, through a third person acting as a messenger...)the entire experience is capped off with the phenomenal teaching team! all the utops and prof jonathon really put in the effort to make sure students extract maximum value from the course, from explaining concepts on telegram round-the-clock to crafting masterful lecture quizzes and homeworks that put cs 1231 s to abject shame.overall, this will probably go down in my university life as one of the most enriching modules i have ever taken. i will miss it ;(syllabus(with math, putting everything in any order is already a mistake imo, so we'll roll with what the syllabus says...)- real-valued linear systems and gaussian elimination- real-valued matrices (incl. determinants, adjoints/adjugates, lu factorization)- euclidean vector spaces (briefly touched on general vector spaces though...) (independence, (finite) bases, transition matrices)- vector spaces associated with matrices (row/column spaces, nullspace, rank and nullity.)- orthogonality (dot product, orthogonal bases,

module, especially for freshmen without any linear algebra knowledge. although the emphasis here for this module is on computation, one is still expected to at least know how certain theorems are derived. i would encourage one taking this module to try to understand how theorems are derived to make it easier to understand this entire module in general. matlab is allowed for this semester, so it's easier to compute stuff, but expect the standard of assessments to be higher too.lectureslectures are done in a hybrid mode. you watch online lectures on canvas and then you attend a math cafe (basically just a weekly live lecture to recap all the things you have learnt online) in real life. i did not attend any of the math cafes because it starts at 4 pm, but i would encourage one to watch the recorded one. math cafe is not just a recap of the concepts, but you are stretched to understand the concepts further. also, prof jonathon conducts an informal live quiz session before the start of each math cafe, top 3 winners will get toblerones (i think it's prof's favourite snack) as prize.tutorialstutorials are weekly. if you are lucky, you get prof jonathon as your tutor. i did not get him as my tutor, but i went to his tutorial anyway. no attendance is taken so i doubt he can tell who actually belongs to his tutorial group. also, i see different faces every week for tutorial, so i guess it's common to just attend prof jonathon's tutorial anyway. he is very good at explaining the concepts, although at times he may get too over-enthusiastic about it and talk about some concepts that are not in the syllabus. i learn new things every single tutorial. to be honest, i rarely read in details the lecture notes, so i tend to miss out some concepts. his tutorials helped me to fill up the information gaps.telegram helpthere is also a telegram chat for ma 1522, as mentioned by another student below, you can read more details about it.assessments-lecture quizzes 20% (>92% average

he mentioned he wanted to have a bellcurve for the papers. midterm paper was very difficult, because it's mostly multiple response questions, and the time given was very little (1.5 hours for 20 questions). it is doable but you need to be fast at thinking and typing out the matlab commands. homeworks are quite difficult as well, i spent quite a lot of time on each, but try your best to get full marks for it because almost everyone does (cough cough, you can compare answers with your friends). lecture quizzes are to test basic concepts, but expect to spend some time on it if you plan to max out your scores for lecture quizzes. will update more about finals in due time. special note: ma 1101 r and ma 2001 papers are totally deceptive as they are mostly testing on manual computations and some proofs (irrelevant to ma 1522), rather than testing on concepts. look at past ma 1522 papers for better representation.finalsi found finals to be significantly tougher than the one from ay

introductory linear algebra module that covers wide range of topics, including concepts like eigenspaces and svd decomposition. this is a hybrid module, where lecture contents were prerecorded and the actual f 2 f lecture slot served as a recitation session. though the f 2 f lecture was not mandatory, it's a pretty great session for me to revise the content learnt throughout the videos. in addition, the lecturer spent some time going through exercises and optional challenges which were mostly proof-based. even though this course does not require you to write any proofs (spoken by the lecturer himself), going through proofs really helped be consolidate my thoughts and make this course more fulfilling.speaking of the lecturer, he was very kind and dedicated to his teaching. even though his teaching style was a little bit dry compared to previous iterations of this module, he's still great and very friendly. i also had some small talks with him before the session in later weeks. it's kinda sad that not many people did attend his lecture. i wish more people attended his lecture in the future.assessments- a lot of lecture quiz (it gets kinda annoying at times)- three

me this sem. topics are very interlinked so you need to make sure you understand every concept. prof jonathon is a passionate lecturer and provides many avenues for you to clarify your doubts such as lectures (called math cafe) and even a telegram channel. i recommend taking this in sem 1 just to meet prof jonathon haha, who has the superpower to flip su mindset towards this module.chapters:1) linear systems 2) matrix algebra 3) euclidean vector spaces 4) subspaces associated to a matrix 5) orthogonality & least squares solution 6) eigenvectors 7) linear transformationsummary:ma 1522 focuses on computational applications of linear algebra concepts for computing students. even as a year 1 student, you see linear algebra concepts pop up in other modules as well (eg. bt 1101) so this course nicely ties in. conceptually, this was a very challenging module as it is far more abstract than the maths i encountered previously in junior college. even after taking this module, i'm not quite sure if i am able to ""think geometrically"" about some of the concepts covered in my head.the course has online videos on canvas, which are the most important content. they are narrated by prof jonathon who explains through the concepts concisely and clearly. it is quite normal to rewatch the videos or consult youtube sources for further clarification on the topics, due to the difficulty of linear algebra. there is also the optional math cafe/lecture with prof jonathon every thursday which further clarify and expand on the online learning content. i found it quite useful to attend math cafe, as it allowed me to test whether i truly understood the content, many times after attending the cafe, i realized i did not lol. the math cafe provided some useful elaborations on the content taught and has some nice revision quiz at the start (you can even win tolberones/feastables if you are in the top 3). besides that, i really enjoyed prof jonathon's enthusiasm and humor.starting from week 3, there are also optional tutorial sessions which go through the tutorial assignment focusing on the previous week's topics. attendance is not taken and teaching quality varies. prof jonathon also teaches some classes, so many students choose to attend his.graded components:homework assignments (20%)- 3 homework assignments over the semester with 2.5-3 week deadlines- consists of 3 questions, generally harder than tutorials, but discussion is allowed with smart friends/telegram- relatively easy to get full marks but marking may vary among gradersonline learning quizzes (20%)- 1 5 question quiz for each subtopic of the course- score is taken from average of all your attempts- get above 4.6 for all your quizzes to get full marks for this componentmidterms mcq (20%)- 20 mcq questions, quite challenging as i recall- prepare some matlab scripts so that you don't have to type out every line of code or recall what functions to use.- practice typing skills as you may have to type some large matricesfinals (40%)- has 20 mcq questions and 3 open ended questions- easier than midterms and mainly on matlab computation rather than on thorough understanding of contentconclusion:ma 1522 is a very well put together module and is ultimately challenging but rewarding. prof jonathon is one of the best lecturers i have encountered so far and encourages you to explore and question the concepts taught. there are many avenues for you to seek help, so do not feel daunted. enjoy the experience and don't give up. this is a course, where the journey is equally or even more memorable and  rewarding than the end result.overall grades:1. lecture quizzes: 20/202. homework assignments: 20/203. midterm exam: 14.5/204. final exam: ???actual grade: a-(pleasantly

matlab.lecturethere is technically no lectures, with course content taught asynchronously through canvas. however, there is a weekly math cafe at the l 2 timeslot (thursdays 4-6 pm), where professor jonathon teo covers the content meant for that week. each math cafe starts with a pollev quiz where the top 3 or so students gets feastable / toblerone. it is then followed by a rehashing of the concepts taught in the lecture though with a bit more extras. prof teo is very passionate in whatever he is teaching, and it shows. i consider him amongst the best of the lecturers you can find across nus. he explains things in a clear and animated manner, sometimes using his fingers to get us to ""think geometrically"", which is absolutely necessary for such an abstract topic for a freshman.tutorialit so happens that my tutorial is also taught under prof teo, and he brings the same energy in math cafe to tutorials as well. these tutorials are 1-2 weeks behind the math cafe. there are 11 of them in total, and they do a good job at teaching the concepts, and then also getting you to use matlab to automate the computations.assessmentlecture quizzes: 20%midterm exam (week

final grade of the quiz is the average of all attempts, so it is important that you do not screw up your first few attempts or you will find yourself attempting the same quiz >20 times just to salvage your grade. that's because scoring >92% in the quiz will result in you attaining 100% of the grade, which means that on average your eventual grade for each quiz should be at least 4.61/5. meanwhile, the 3 homeworks can be done on paper or digitally, and are submitted digitally on canvas, and you can discuss the solutions on the cohort-wide telegram chat with 850 people in it.the mid-term exam was done on examplify, with 20 mcq/mrq questions, open book closed internet, over 1.5 hours on a friday night. there was a time crunch and it is practically a competition on who can type matlab commands the fastest. some people even wrote programs to speed up their computation! but it's worth noting that many of these questions aren't merely computational, but are very tricky in concept as well. this is similar to the finals, except that it was 2 hours long, with 15 3-mark mcq questions and 35 marks of written questions.conclusioni am part of the 2 nd cohort of soc students taking ma 1522 in this form, so there is only 1 past year paper that we can work with. previously, soc students would take ma 1101 r or ma 2001, but those people had to do their exams without matlab, so the questions were much more computational or proof-based in nature. these computational questions that would take minutes to do by hand, can be solved in seconds by matlab, a tool that is much more powerful than graphing calculators.holding the entire course together is the 16 equivalent statements of invertibility. the main additional content covered over ma 1101 r or ma 2001, used by the math majors, are the lu, qr, and svd factorisation. looking back as someone who’s formerly a h 2 math student, i appreciate how linear algebra can be used as an abstraction for solving a system of linear equations (rref), dot product (orthogonality), and a generalisation of lines and planes (linear spaces) in the topic of vectors. h 2 further math students may find much of the course a revision of what they have learnt, but there are new concepts that are covered, such as the aforementioned factorisations, adjoint, elementary & transition matrices, least squares solution, orthogonality, the gram-schmidt process, & orthogonal diagonalisation.resultshomework 1: 40/40 (median: 39)homework 2: 40/40 (median: 40)homework 3: 40/40 (median: 40)midterm exam: 14.67/20 (median: 12.5)see more 00 replyshare

tried to do the mcq due to lack of time or lack of understanding, this resulted in many of my friends guessing the mcq such as putting all cs or all ds. the open ended questions were simple but due to the fact that no gc was allowed almost everyone were unable to finish the paper even after skipping the mcq. even after the papers the answers among students were extremely weird as a lot of calculations error was imposed due to how tedious it is. this is good for me as i just want to su this mod but probably irritating to people who actually studied for this mod.remarks:i spent about 1 day on this module as i had the intention to su  this mod and the cs mods/specialisation i plan on taking does not use linear algebra. for anyone planning to su i recommend taking this mod in s 2 compared to s 1, this is becuz 40% of the grades were literally free and no midterms. also no matlab is used so one does not need to know matlab saving more time. i argue one can pass simply by just knowing how to convert a matrix to rrel. overall linear algebra is a good mod but i simply have little use for it.see more 00 replyshare ›−+ddong zhu! buxu zou!dong zhu! buxu zou!a year agofinal

highfinals: 60%14 mcq questions (28 marks) and 72 marks of open-ended questionsit appears that many of my peers and me were not too interested in studying for this (given the priority for other modules). 2 hours was nowhere near enough to finish the paper, especially given the difficult trivia-esque mcq questions that i spent far too long on, and thus i did only around 60 marks' worth. some of the open-ended questions were more doable, and one of the 4 oe questions did seem to be intended as a giveaway. otherwise, different topics were combined into different parts of the same oe question.remarks:i didn’t spend very much time on this module. tutorials were useful, although i gave up on doing the tutorial sheets beforehand after a few tutorials, and attempted to understand everything i could during the session. prof tan would pick random students who attended his tutorials and ask for solutions to specific questions to be submitted to him beforehand. he was good at explaining/breaking down questions and explaining methods to try them with, and pointed out more efficient methods where possible. dr wang fei’s lectures were great (other than timing, but the recording quality is great), and he was good at breaking down fairly abstract concepts (although i still got very lost in the last 2 topics).workload on a whole is very manageable, but concepts build on each other as the module progresses, so it is important to be comfortable with the earlier ones.expected grade: bsee more 00 replyshare ›show more replies −+ccheesefishballsa year agoediteday 23/24

proving. proving questions are plentiful in this course, and some (particularly the dang rank questions) require creative solutions. cs 1231 s helped a little though.another difficult aspect was the fact that so many concepts here are interlinked. it can be very daunting even near the end of the course to know that even the week 1 topics were intertwined with the week 10 and 11 ones. however,

iteration of the introductory linear algebra course for soc students, which seeks to replace ma 2001 (with the exception of math ddp students). we start off with learning about linear systems, matrices, determinants, subspaces, linear independence, bases and dimension. after the midterms, we move on to rank, orthogonality, least squares, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, diagonalisation, and finally linear transformations.key differences from ma 2001 are that exams are fully open book, and we are allowed to use any offline calculator to compute our answers. we are also taught how to use matlab to compute problems, however some students prefer to use python, which is also fine. there are little to no proving questions in the examinations. we also learn svd, lu and qr factorisation, which are not taught in ma 2001.workloadlow to medium. there is lesser content compared to the other soc modules / ma 1521, however some effort is definitely required to have a strong understanding of the concepts involved.lectures are 2 x 2 h per week, fully recorded. attendance is not taken. i enjoyed prof jonathon's lectures a lot. before starting the lecture, he will host a quiz, which is filled with many tricky questions to test our conceptual understanding from the previous lecture. he is also particularly excited about anything related to ""eigen"", even going so far as to set it as the password for our finals. he is very passionate and knowledgeable and even uploads his own tutorial slides for everyone to read (on top of the suggested solutions). sadly, i did not attend live lectures after the first few weeks as they were both at 8 am.tutorials are 1 h a week, conducted by a ta or one of the profs. all tutorial worksheets are released at the start of the semester. since attendance is also not taken, many students (myself included) chose to attend prof jonathon's tutorial instead, sometimes leading to overcrowding in the classroom. what is unique about his tutorials is that he begins with a summary of the past week's lectures, which is extremely useful for revision. on top of going through the suggested solutions, he also demonstrates the matlab code for solving the questions, so that we will be able to compute it efficiently during the examinations. finally, he shares alternate approaches to help us develop geometric intuition for solving certain problem sets.once a week, there will be graded weekly canvas quizzes which consist of mcqs or short answer questions. you are given unlimited attempts and there are even comments to explain the answer after submission, hence you should be doing it a maximum of twice to get full marks. do take note of the deadline since some students (including me) are forgetful. nonetheless, the profs will always send out a reminder for you to complete the quizzes. almost everyone will get the full 10%.there are 3 homework assignments given out throughout the semester, and we are given 2-3 weeks to work on them. they are relatively easy so the median is always full marks. they hold a pretty hefty weightage (15%) so do check your answers thoroughly before submitting. it will be wise to check with your friends too.lastly, if you have extra free time, you may attempt the exercises in the recommended textbook, or try out the extra questions at the back of the weekly tutorial worksheets.examinationsmidterms was a 1 hour 30 minute paper with 20 mcqs (80 m) and 2 open-ended questions in section b (20 m). the median was 48/80 for mcq and 8/20 for section b. the questions were not thenormand most students i spoke to did not finish the paper. prepare yourself for tricky and difficult problems to solve under extreme time pressure.finals was a 2 hour paper with 15 mcqs (45 m) and 5 open-ended questions in section b (55 m). there was a greater emphasis on content taught in the later half of the semester. there were many questions on lu, qr and svd in section b. rather frustratingly, the matrices given were often partially masked, or contained variables in them, which means we were unable to compute them with matlab. the questions were notelementaryat all - strong conceptual and intuitive understanding was required to solve some of the harder questions in the paper. nevertheless, i found this paper easier than the midterms, probably because i actually started to put in effort for the second half of the semester.examinations were all conducted on examplify. mcq answers were submitted online (directly through examplify) while the written answers were scanned and uploaded onto canvas with our phones after the exam (for midterms), or submitted physically (for finals).tipsthe key to doing well in ma 1522 is to understand things geometrically. prof jonathon always emphasises this in his lectures. rather than memorising content, we should understand key ideas well to solve problems. as he says, ""bring a basis to the exam, not a subspace""! i also recommend 3 b 1 b's youtube series on linear algebrato solidify your understanding of the subject intuitively.linear algebra will probably seem more abstract than the typical arithmetic you are used to, especially if you come from a jc background. hence, you may often face struggles during the course. i found it very difficult to keep up with the proofs taught during lectures, often having to re-read the lecture notes multiple times to fully understand the derivation of certain theorems. in my opinion, thedeterminantof your success in ma 1522 is to remainconsistent, persevere, and really sit down to question every concept taught to you and why things seem to be the way they are. prof jonathon calls this ""meditating"" and it was actually one of the most empowering things he said to me to inspire me to press on for this module (i was intending to s/u the module beforehand).nearer to the examinations, prof loke and prof jonathon will open consultation slots on canvas.spanningthe reading week, they are highly popular and are often fully booked. thus, i recommend that you clarify any doubts with your ta or the professors on a regularbasis. for me, i found out that prof jonathon was open to consultations after his tutorial slot, so i stayed back on a few occasions to clarify my doubts privately with him.lastly, i must say that some of the past year papers for ma 2001 were difficult, especially the proving questions. if it helps, not a single one of those proving questions came out during our finals. it seems that the professors are focusing a lot more on applications rather than theinverse(mathematical proving), which makes sense, given that this module is geared towards computing students.(p.s. matlab has many cool functions which will make your life much easier in the exams. spend some time playing with it.)final wordsthe difficulty of this module really discouraged me at the start, but the support and encouragement given by the professors helped me to tide through difficult times. since the concepts are all related to each other, ensure you have a solid foundation of the techniques taught in the earlier weeks (e.g. rref, invertible matrix theorem), as you will continue to use them to solve problems up to the final chapter.for those interested, prof jonathon runsutopfor ma 1522 if you are keen to assist him in the pedagogical aspects of the course. nus also

tutorial~30-45 mins of pre-lecture online videos to watchthis module has a light workload overall, as other reviewers mentioned since there are no assignments.lecturespre-lecture videos are dry (since they are recorded with ai voice anyway), but are of good quality, straightforward and concise. i generally play these at 1.5-1.75 x speed.for the physical lectures, i stopped attending them after recess week, but dr. chew is very clear in explaining concepts and solutions. in the lectures, he will explain more difficult examples (colored blue in lecture notes), and re-explain some meaningful questions discussed in the videos. also, he is quite a humorous guy so i guess that makes attending lecture more enjoyable. even though lecture quizzes are graded on completion, take it as practice to get them correct and do them seriously as it will help you later on for exams.tutorialstutorial questions are generally straightforward and doable. as for my tutor (grad student), he usually mumbles and talks so softly so i can't understand what he says at times.examsmidterms were mostly straightforward with most questions looking like those of sample papers, but with 2-3 trickier and harder questions. finals, as mentioned by others below, was difficult and much harder than the sample papers given. maybe dr. chew has heard of the st 2334 jokes and decided to make the paper harder (lol). personally i found the part on f, t, chi-squared distributions most difficult.final thoughtsthe course content is straightforward, and i would say that it's easier than most 1 k math mods. however, people are right when they say the bell curve for this course is steep.now, i would like to give my thoughts as someone who took st 1131. the contents of this course (minus f, t, chi-squared distributions) have already been covered in st 1131, and st 1131 even covers more topics (r coding, linear regression, etc), so this course might actually be lighter than st 1131. so if you are someone who plans to take this module to fulfill a minor or second major in statistics, then you might already learn everything beforehand in st 1131. you might consider taking st 2131 + st 2132 to learn more, albeit the harder content.tips 1. read everything carefully. this mod is prone to careless mistakes, and during my semester many people did not realize there was an mrq in the midterms.2.

content ----------------------we begun the module with event operations, properties and relations and then moved onto pnc, which i have never been good at, axioms and properties of probability, independence theorem, law of total probability and bayes theorem. after this was the computation of expectation and variance of discrete and continuous variables, as well as the probabality function and graphs and cumulative probability function and graphs of discrete and continous variables.midterms covered only 2 of the 7 chapters and was quite challenging, because i was very confused with almost every pnc question and misunderstood the functions of a discrete variable.then there was joint probability, marginal probability and conditional probability in chapter 3, which you may have encountered during gea 1000, but with more depth and mathematical concepts. a good grasp of double integrals is preferred for understanding, but it don't think it is necessary for the exams (the exam was on examplify and you can use a computer). chapter 4 went into the different types of distributions, which i think covered the bulk of the content for this module. most of the questions dealt with some type of distribution from this chapter, making this chapter the most important one in my opinion. after this was sampling distributions consisting of central limit theorem, chi-squared, f-distributions. the bulk of chapter 6 was on calculation of confidence intervals and error estimates and the last chapter, 7, was on hypothesis testing, which is almost the same content as a-level statistics.---------------- review --------------------this module was the dryest thing i've ever taken and nothing short of a formula spam for the most part. we were just taught to accept the formula as is, and proofs were sparse, if any at all. i seldom understood the intuition behind the formulation of the theorem we were taught during the lecture. most of the time i had to search on the internet myself for the relevant proof in my own time, as sometimes they are also not provided on the notes.after the lecturer, prof would post a quiz (marked as lecture attendence), but sometimes with incorrect options that would confuse us a lot. i emailed him once, asking if an option was written in error, and he replied that it wasn't, only for my friend to email the same question with more details, for him to reply that there was indeed a typo. if i hadn't asked my friend for prof's reply, i would have continued believing there was no typo.the lecturer speaks in a very loud (as he is lecturing to the entire auditorium) but monotone voice with little variation, reading almost the same content from the slides and notes and, coupled with an 8 am class, made the lecture so much more difficult to pay attention to.at the last lecture, right before finals, it was entirely remote and prof went through the past year papers at his office over zoom. surprising, this is the first time his lecture sounded tolerable. as he was not straining his voice, his speech pattern was easier to grasp and made the lecture easier to pay attention to.midterms (mcq and mrq) was challenging enough for me whenever pnc were involved, but i knew my probability and event properties fairly well, which consisted of majority of the tricky questions, so it wasn't too bad.despite the dryness of the content, i prepared and practiced really hard for finals by doing all the tutorial questions, the practice exam and writing my own notes for the module.finals was much longer and more difficult, with the addition of fill in black questions. it was trickier as sometimes you need to apply some concepts as a shortcut to get the answer, as opposed to direct computation which is meant to be impossible to do. this requires a good understanding of the mechanics behind the theorems taught.for example, there was an question asking for the covariance of two variables involving the computation of the gauss error function (an integral, if evaluated by hand, is nearly impossible to express in familiar terms) and it is impossible to directly solve it, but if you know about the independence of two variables and see that the question satisfies this condition, you may deduce the covariance to be zero without doing a single step of integration. a lot of the questions were relevant to chapter 4 and the types of distributions.like one comment pointed out, a good excel spreadsheet to help you compute the probability of distributions, sampling tests, variance and expection is very useful, and you can use this in the exam.---------------- grade breakdown --------------------the grade breakdown consists of almost only midterm and final results, plus 6 of the best of 11 in-lecture quizzes. finals takes up a massive percentage and made the preparation for the exam very stressful.lecture quiz: 10% (choose only best 6 of 11)midterms: 20%finals: 70%expected grade: 🙏see more 00 replyshare

papers to get a hang of the concepts (i felt that confidence interval requires some practice to gain some...confidence :p). 3 days is generally sufficient to study and practice for everything, max is

the probability section of this module is basically just a watered down version of cs 1231's probability (and not to mention, no proving). dr david is a nice teacher, though he is extremely dry and slow. you can afford not to attend his lectures, though it must be said that after recess week, it was done in a flipped classroom format. the reason why i said that is his lecture basically consists of him reading though the notes, with not much input into it. heck, i stopped watching any webcasts after the 3 rd week, as i can't bear sitting through him reading off the notes, even at 2 x speed.he emphasised that the module is about understanding the statistical tools and applying it, not trying to prove correctness of those tools or justifying why they are used. well, that means the bell curve would be super harsh (and this explains my expected grade), as exams degrade to more of finding out who is good at calculating and not making mistakes. graphing calculators are allowed for the exams and that really helps for those who are bad at differentation/integration, as you can quickly solve those probability distribution functions without any effort at all.tldr: minimal effort to get a

curriculum was quite different in previous semesters. for us, however, the module was a complete cakewalk. unfortunately that means the bell curve is ridiculous. to put that b+ into perspective - i obtained 39/40 for the mid-terms, attended all tutorials, and completed all quizzes with full marks except two where i lost two marks. while it's hard to gauge how well i did for the finals, i don't believe i made significantly more mistakes than my peers. all that is still not sufficient to obtain an a in this module.the first half is almost entirely covered by h 2 a level statistics and probability. you shouldn't need to attend any lecture for the first six weeks. skim through the lecture slides if you're worried about missing anything.the second half of the module introduces a few novel concepts like joint probability distribution, but even then a lot of the content is h 2 stats, like hypothesis testing. some integration is also required for the normalization and calculation of the probability distribution function, but again nothing h 2 math has not taught.dr. david chew is a good lecturer. he explains concepts clearly and with a fair amount of rigor, and his lectures are generally pretty good. unfortunately the lectures are extremely slow, because the curriculum is so basic. the second half of this module is taught in flipped classroom style. this made little difference since we were not attending lectures anyway.tutorials are fortnightly 2-hour affairs where you are split into groups to discuss your solution before presenting them to the class. most tutorials are pretty simple, and should not present too much of a challenge. there are also weekly quizzes, which again are very simple, and serve no purpose other than to force you to keep up with the curriculum.for the exams you are allowed one help sheet for the mid-terms, and two for the finals. calculators are allowed, and integration results from calculators are allowed to be used without

professors are very clear in their explanation. i did not seek any extra consultation, so i can't judge that. tutorials were taught by a ta whom i didn't really understand, since there were many times she went quite fast. given that tutorials have many questions for each set, it is quite a challenge to cover all the content and ensure that everyone understands. if you don't, i recommend staying back or emailing the ta/profs when necessary.first half covered basic probability rules like inclusion-exclusion principle. the things with regards to intersection and union, as well as probability of x happening. second half went on the statistics part, like normal distribution. if it sounds familiar, means you're probably pretty much safe for this module once you get back all the information you've lost previously. if it doesn't, then you need to put in extra care in paying attention to class and doing the various tutorials/examples within lecture notes and all that good stuff. you should be fine.finals comes with cheat sheets, so do your best in cramming examples/formulae and rely on that during finals. works wonders like any other exam with cheat sheets.not a difficult module,
