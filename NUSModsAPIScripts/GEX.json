We begin by exploring a selection of topics where absences seem to play an important role in a specific domain of inquiry or activity, such as art, human cognition, and justice. Then we consider whether we are right to treat such phenomena as genuine parts of the world, or whether a conception of the world which contains only material objects can provide an adequate understanding of the subject areas in question."

Towards that end, we will read texts across multiple academic disciplines alongside cinematic representations. Finally, as a writing course, students will develop critical reading practices and media literacy skills to contribute to this conversation through their own interdisciplinary and multimodal compositions, which will include analytical, argumentative, and research writing as well as a short videographic essay."

We will first learn theories about aspects of videogames such as gameplay, narrative, and aesthetics. With these theories, we will try to explain how videogames achieve their effects, discuss criteria for evaluating videogames, and analyze concepts central to game studies. Students will learn to appreciate the unique capacities of videogames as a distinct medium, the elements they share with other media, and frameworks for understanding their effects on players."

Those shared visions of war enable us to fight it and confront its trauma. This course examines the changing imagination of war across history. Focusing mainly on English-speaking cultures, it examines poems, books, films, songs, plays, news reports, letters, speeches and tv programmes. It asks how they represent war, and how representations change over time and under pressure from technology, events and political thought."

Irony presupposes disjunctions \u2013 between what is said and what is meant, what is perceived and what is real. It thus involves a critical attitude in exploiting and/or perceiving disjunctions. It is often directed with negative effect towards figures and structures of authority, and is sometimes an integral part of a world-view. Students will engage closely with a variety of texts of different types, including poems, tracts, short stories, speeches, plays, sketches, songs and pictures. In doing so, they will reach a better understanding of the roles irony can play not only in literature, but also in society more generally. Since the texts are drawn from different historical times, media and geographical locations, students will get a sense of the widespread use of irony in culture and society."

Is there a universal, objective reader, or are readers historically specific, biased and always \"subjects\"? If a reader constructs the text, can the text in turn construct the reader? We will think about these questions by operating on several levels: (1) by discussing literature and films that thematise reading; (2) by assessing how thinkers have debated the reader's role; and (3) by examining our own processes of reading."

In this course we will examine some of the ways these questions have been explored in art, advertising, philosophy, and literature. Students will consider how we look at animals, read the views of influential philosophers, and immerse themselves in literary texts that imagine animals. The course will conclude with an examination of a provocative text by the novelist J. M. Coetzee, who stages a confrontation between philosophy and literature on the question of imagining animals."

Throughout the course, we will also consider whether ancient technologies of the self are still relevant today and to what extent contemporary selfimprovement approaches and forms of digital selffashioning are modern examples of technologies of the self or a qualitatively different phenomenon."
