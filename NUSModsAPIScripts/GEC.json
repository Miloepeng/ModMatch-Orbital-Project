    "desc": "Southeast Asia is widely regarded as a model for economic development due to its advances in alleviating poverty, improving infrastructure, and fostering education and healthcare. But economic success often overshadows critical social problems that arise in tandem with such rapid development. This course, offered only in special summer sessions, takes a hands-on approach to examining critical issues in social development, in particular those revolving around local empowerment, democratization, and sustainability. Working within a framework of participatory action research, and collaborating with peers at another ASEAN university, this rigorous course includes substantial fieldwork conducted among development projects outside of Singapore."

We begin with this question and then turn to the different approaches of analyzing social movements. We will also consider how states and other movement opponents suppress and control social movements, and how movements respond to repression, and deploy, even spread, their ideas, strategies, and tactics within and across movements, as well as across national borders. In examining these issues, we will use case studies, and discuss the role of law, including how it matters to the social control of social movements, movement strategies, tactics, and decision-making, and movement effects."

This course examines the impact of the leadership\u2019s ideological assumptions on how Singapore navigates its relations with 3 major areas, ASEAN, the US and the regional powers, China and India and adapts to the current inflection point in the international diplomacy of Indo-Pacific region."

Technology produces culture as much as the other way around. But such a relationship is complex and controversial. Both technology and cultural producers are not often selfreflexive about how the relationship impacts on their work, and unaware of the resulting ethical dilemmas and politics. This course introduces students to critical concepts in culture and technology studies focusing on social and political change, transformations in the way we think about civilization, and the formation of identity."

This introductory course to ecofeminism will combine literary analysis, environmental humanities and feminism. It will extend students\u2019 knowledge of feminism and environmental issues relating to women. Fundamental to the study will be the literary analysis of texts taught in a scaffolded way. The course will examine literary texts by Asian women across South, East and Southeast Asia."

How have these definitions changed the way we think? What kinds of problems have these definitions created? In this module, we will analyse various moments in intellectual history when there has been a struggle over the meaning of \"gender\" (and seemingly related terms like \"sex\" and \"sexuality\") in order to understand the term's function as a category of analysis."
