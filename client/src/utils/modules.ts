It shows how science can stand behind apparently outlandish claims, and put this knowledge to practical use. The \u201cexperimental metaphysics\u201d aspect of quantum physics is introduced through the description of paradigmatic phenomena. Then the history and current challenges are presented, with a special focus on the emerging quantum technologies."

The course will consist of four chapters, broadly described below. Getting data: collection/sampling, experiments/observational studies, data cleaning/recoding, interpreting summary statistics (mode, mean, quartiles, standard deviation, etc.). Categorical data analysis: bar plots, contingency tables, rates/ratios, association, Simpson\u2019s Paradox. Dealing with numerical data: histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, correlation, ecological and atomistic fallacies, simple linear regression. Statistical Inference: probability, conditional probability, prosecutor's fallacy, base rate fallacy, conjunction fallacy, understanding hypothesis tests, interpreting confidence intervals, learning about a population based on a sample, simple simulation. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be incorporated extensively into the content. Students will appreciate that even simple plots and contingency tables can give them valuable insights about data.

    "desc": "This course offers an opportunity to grapple with some of the most enduring challenges to human thought. Our starting point is a conception of ourselves as free and conscious beings equipped with bodies that allow us to observe and explore a familiar external world. Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed."

From pirates to privateers, corsairs to raiders, maritime predators take various names and forms. This course explores the history of pirates and piracy. By examining case studies from the 1400s onwards and by placing pirates into the context of oceanic history and maritime studies, students will be able to demystify the popular images often associated with pirates."

Technology produces culture as much as the other way around. But such a relationship is complex and controversial. Both technology and cultural producers are not often selfreflexive about how the relationship impacts on their work, and unaware of the resulting ethical dilemmas and politics. This course introduces students to critical concepts in culture and technology studies focusing on social and political change, transformations in the way we think about civilization, and the formation of identity."

We will explore how moral reasoning from multiple perspectives applies to local concerns such as equality, meritocracy, multiculturalism, immigration, and marriage. This will challenge us to identify moral problems created by social and technological changes, combine ethical principles with practical constraints, and balance the interests of individuals and communities. We will also consider how moral dialogue can be cultivated in Singapore\u2019s multicultural society, so as to manage diverse traditions and divergent values."

This course presents techniques that address these distinctive characteristics of embedded software implementation. Topics include embedded software development for programmable processors and reconfigurable hardware, component-based design, optimizations for performance, power, code size, operating system issues, and case studies of available systems."
